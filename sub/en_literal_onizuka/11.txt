OPENING THEME SONG

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the street. Children's voices are heard from somewhere.

Children: Ha ha ha...

Children: Ahahahaha. Try to hit it!

Children: Eh.

Children: (laugh)

Children: Yeah, I hit it! I hit it!

 *Shigeru buys a drink can at a vending machine.
*"Coin Cleaning - Open 24 hours"

 *Maya and Ritsuko are in the shop.

Cleaning Machine: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Ritsuko: Cleaning doesn't come cheap...

Maya:   I'd at least like some time to do some washing myself, don't you 
        think?

Shigeru: We're better off because at least we can do this back home.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *A subway ticket gate

 *A train is coming to the station

 *Kozo reads a newspaper

 *Ritsuko, Shigeru and Maya

Ritsuko: The Sub-Commander.

Ritsuko: Good morning.

Shigeru & Maya: Good morning, sir.

Kozo:   Well. Morning.

Ritsuko: You're so early today.

Kozo:   I'm headed to the upper town for Ikari.

Ritsuko: I see. The committee's regular meeting is today, I suppose.

Kozo:   A silly business. Ikari is always forcing his trivial duties on 
        me and I wouldn't know how to do them without Magi.

Ritsuko: An election for the city council will soon be taking place in the 
        upper town.

Kozo:   The city council is pure decoration. In actual fact, it's the Magi
        who are in charge of this city.

Maya:   Magi? You mean the three super computers?

Kozo:   It's run by the majority rule of three types of computers.
        The system is exactly based on the democratic fundamentals.

Maya:   Does the council follow Magi's decisions exclusively?

Kozo:   It's an effective government that can minimize wastes.

Maya:   As the purely scientific city it is. This is an era when the science
        is omnipotent.

Shigeru: Old-fashioned words.

Kozo:   Come to think of it, you have an experiment set for Unit One,
        don't you?

Ritsuko: Yes. The second experiment for extending its activation time is 
        to take place at 10:30 today.

Kozo:   I'm expecting good news.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The panel shows "Emergency"

 *Ritsuko at the laboratory for the experiment

Ritsuko: Stop the experiment. Cut the circuits.

 *Eva-00 in the cage

Maya:   Switching the circuits.

Male Staff: Power supply is getting operating.

Ritsuko: As I thought, that is a problem.

Maya:   Yes. I'm worryied that the converson efficiency is no less than
        0.008 below the theoretical value.

Male Staff: The value is correct up to the largest error in measurement.
        What will we do?

Ritsuko: Lower the interconversion by 0.01 and try it again with the same
        settings.

Maya:   Roger.

Ritsuko: Well, we're starting the reactivation experiment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"In the still darkness."

Episode 11

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Misato in the elevator

 *Ryoji is running to the elevator

Ryoji:  Hey! Just a moment!

 *Misato push the button to close the door

Ryoji:  Ouch!

Misato: Shit!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Misato and Ryoji in the elevator

Ryoji:  Yeah. I was running and running. Ha. You seem to be in a bad mood 
        today.

Misato: 'Cause I saw you right after I got here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji at a payphone

Telephone Operator: Yes. Hold on, please.

Gendo:  What?

Shinji: Er... Err... Well, Father...

Gendo: What's the matter? Be quick!

Shinji: Haa...

Shinji: Err, well... Today at the school I was told to inform my parent
        that a career guidance interview will be taking place, but...

Gendo:  I entrusted Katsuragi-kun with such concerns--don't call me
        with foolish news. 
        Don't pass phone calls like that on to me.

Shinji: Ah!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Elevator suddenly stops

Misato: Well.

 *Blackout

Ryoji:  A power failure?

Misato: That's impossible. It can't happen.

Misato: Something's strange. An accident?

Ryoji:  Maybe Akagi screwed up an experiment?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 *In the laboratory

Maya:   The Main power supply is non-operational. The voltage reads zero.

Ritsuko: No. I did nothing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *In the elevator

Ryoji:  What do you think?

Misato: The power should be switched to the Standby supply soon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the control room

Shigeru: No. The Standby circuit isn't operating.

Kozo:   That can't be. How are the operating circuits?

Female staff: 1.2 percent in all. Only 9 circuits from No. 2567.

Kozo:   Use all operational power supplies to maintain Magi and Central
        Dogma.

Shigeru: But that will interfere with life-support in the entire building.

Kozo:   That's fine. This is a top priority issue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Makoto in the town with Misato's laundry

Female Announcement: Remember Takahashi Nozomu, Takahashi Nozomu.
        Thank you for your support.

Makoto: She really is a careless person. I think that Katsuragi-san
        ought to take her own laundry herself. What?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka on the street

Asuka: That's only 'cause Commander Ikari was just too busy.

Shinji: I was wondering about that. I think that there was a failure 
        rather than him just hanging up on me.

Asuka:  As a man, you shouldn't worry over every little detail, don't you 
        think?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *At the entrance of Nerv Headquarters

 *The gate doesn't work

Shinji: What?

Asuka:  Wha'cha doin'? Hey, take my place. Hmm. Ah? Hmm, hmm, hmm... 
        Damn it! It's gotta be broken!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Male staff tries to open the door by force

Staff:  Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho.

 *Ritsuko and Maya go through the open door

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya walks on the passsage.

Ritsuko: Anyway, let's hurry to the control center. I can't believe
        that the power supply has not yet been restored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator Misato repeatedly pushes a button

Misato: It's an emergency.

Ryoji:  What's the power supply system like?

Misato: Main, Sub, and Standby. Three systems. I can't believe that all 
        systems failed simultaneously.

Ryoji:  That means...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo's face in the control room

Gendo:  We have to believe that the breakers were activated by someone 
        rather than them working correctly.

Kozo:   No matter what caused it, we'll be in serious trouble if an
        Angel appears at a time like this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Fuchu Overall Headquarters of UN Force

 *General Watch & Control Room

Male Operator: An unidentified object has been detected by the search
        rader.

Commander C: It may be the eighth Angel.

Commander A: Yes. It has to be Angel.

Commander C: What shall we do?

Commander B:

Commander A: Anyway, its destination is Tokyo-3.

Commander C: I agree. There's nothing we can do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Angel is coming in a lake

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the Fuchu UN Headquarters

Male Operator: The Angel has landed.

Female Operator: It's still approaching.

Commander C: Status of Tokyo-3?

Female Operator: It has remained silent.

Commander A: What on Earth are the Nerv personnel doing?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya climb up the wall

Ritsuko: I thought that a trap was simply an old-fashioned ornament. I 
        never imagined that I would use one.

Maya:   Providing is preventing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka, Shinji and Rei try to push buttons to open the doors

Asuka:  Hmm... This doesn't work, either.

Rei:    No facilities work. Strange.

Asuka:  Has something happened in the Geo-front?

Rei:    It's logical to think so.

Shinji: Anyway, let's try to contact Nerv Headquarters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator

Misato: Huh. No. Even the emergency phone doesn't work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the control room

Shigeru: No. Line 77 isn't operating, either.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Rei and Asuka try to call

Rei:    No. I can't connect.

Asuka:  Me, neither. Neither the wire one nor the emergency line are out
   of service.

Shinji: Well. What shall we do?

Asuka:  Ah. Nn, nn...

Shinji: What are you doing?

Asuka:  Are you stupid? An emergency manual.

Rei:    Anyway let's go to Nerv Headquarters.

Asuka:  Good idea. Well, let's elect a leader for our group before we
        do anything else.

Shinji: Ah...

Asuka:  Naturally, I must be the leader. You have no objections, do you?
        Let's go!

Rei:    We can get to Geo-front through Route-07 over there.

Asuka:  Ah!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Door R-07

Shinji: But the doors don't work. Ah, a manual door.

Asuka:  Hey, Shinji, it's your turn.

Shinji: (Nn,nnnn) You only rely on me in situations like this...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *At the Fuchu UN Headquarters

Commander A: Shit, the Joint Staff Council--they only rely on us at the
        front line in situations like this.

Commander B: What's the government saying?

Commander A: Huh. The people in Tokyo-2? I heard they're preparing to 
        escape.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Angel is coming in the mountain

Female Operator: The Angel is still coming here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *At the Fuchu UN Headquarters

Commander B: Anyway contact the people of Nerv.

Commander C: But how?

Commander A: Go yourself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *A plane is flying

Announcement from an airplane: This is the Third District Japan Air 
        Self-Defense Force. An unidentified object is now approaching 
        this location.

Announcement from the airplane: Residents, please go to your designated
   shelters as soon as possible.

 *Makoto on the moving pavement (which isn't currently moving)

Makoto: Big trouble! I must inform Headquarters. But how?

 *A car is coming

Announcement from a car: Remember Takahashi, Takahashi Nozomu, who
        isn't perturbed even in such an emergency.

Makoto: Ah, I'm lucky!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator

Misato: It's rather hot.

Ryoji:  The air conditioners don't work.

Ryoji:  If you don't the heat, you could take off your shirt...

Misato: Eh? (Nnn)

Ryoji:  There's no need to be shy now.

 *Misato continues to wear her jacket

Misato: Don't think improper things, even in a situation like this.

Ryoji:  Fine, fine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya use fans in the control room

Ritsuko: Things are getting worse. And the air is getting staler. These 
        facilities should be the best fruits of modern science.

Maya:   Those are like Commander and Vice-Commander. They're probably 
        bothered by this heat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo puts his legs into a bucket of water

Kozo:   It's lukewarm.

Gendo:  I agree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NEON GENESIS EVANGELION

EPISODE: 11

The Day Tokyo-3 Stood Still

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *A car is driving

Announcer: Due to the state of special emergency in this district, an 
        emergency vehicle is going... Hey, this is a dead end, you know.

Makoto: That's fine. Drive into there!

Announcer: Eh, my!

Makoto: Anyway, this is an emergency.

Driver: Roger.

Help! Stop it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Geo-front

Kozo:   This Geo-front was designed to be a self-sufficient colony if it's 
        ever isolated from the outside. Theoretically this cannot happen 
        to all the power supplies.

Ritsuko: That means that someone did it intentionally.

Gendo:  I would guess that their purpose is to research this place.

 *In the control room

Ritsuko: You mean that they want to guess the structures of Headquarters 
        from the recovery procedures.

Kozo:   That's damn annoying.

Ritsuko: I'll run dummy programs on Magi to make it difficult for them to 
         understand the whole.

Gendo:  I'll leave it up to you.

Ritsuko: Yes.

Kozo:   That the first damage to Headquarters should be caused by people 
        no less human than we are. I cannot bear the thought.

Gendo:  In the end, humanity is its own enemy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka walk in the dark

Shinji: It usually takes only two minutes to get there. Are you sure that
        this is a passage?

Asuka:  If we get there, I'm sure we'll be able to enter the Geo-front.

Shinji: I've heard the same words for some time already.

Asuka:  You do care too much about details! You're so hung up on minor 
        points!

Rei:    Be quiet.

Asuka:  What a good girl...

Rei:    A voice.

Makoto: An Angel is coming, repeat...

 *A light is coming

Shinji & Asuka: It's Hyuga-san. Hey!

Shinji: Hey!

Makoto: An Angel is coming, repeat, an Angel is coming now!

Shinji&Asuka: An Angel is coming!

Rei:    We can't waste time. We should take a shortcut.

Asuka:  I'm the leader--don't take the initiative without my permission!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka, Shinji and Rei crawl through a duct

Asuka:  Damn it! This might be a shortcut, but we're getting filthy.

Shinji: Listen, what do you think Angels are?

Asuka:  What're you babbling about at a time like this?

Shinji: Angels, messengers of the God. Our enemies with Angel names.
        Why are we fighting against them?

Asuka:  Are you an idiot? Unidentified things are invading us, you know.
        It's natural that we'd have to deal with a lot of difficulties
        falling unexpectedly on our heads.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka stands in front of two branches

Asuka:  Well... to the right.

Rei:    I think it's to the left.

Asuka:  Don't bother me! What do you think, Shinji?

Shinji: Hmmm, I don't know.

Asuka:  Hey, come on! Since I'm the leader, you'd better just follow me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka go through the passage

Shinji: Something seems to be strange, just as I expected. The road 
        leads up.

Asuka:  Whaddya mean 'as I expected'? You always talk too much! 
        Ah! Look! This time I'm certain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka open a door with her kick and meets the Angel

Asuka: (Deaa! Ii! Uh! Hii! Nnnn. Huh.) We just saw the Angel with our 
       naked eyes. I'd say we gotta hurry up, don't y'think?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A car is rushing into the control room

Staff:  (Uwaa!)

Makoto: Angel is coming now. I suggest that Eva be readied for a launch.

Maya:   This is serious.

Gendo:  Fuyutsuki, I'm leaving everything to you.

Kozo:   Ikari.

Gendo:  I'm going to the cage to prepare the Evas for a sortie.

Kozo:   You mean that you'll operate them manually?

Gendo:  We have a diesel one for an emergency.

Kozo:   But we have no pilots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka

Shinji: Again.

Rei:    Over here.

Shinji & Asuka: Eh?

Asuka:  (Nn?)

Shinji: Ah!

Asuka:  You're the favorite with Commander Ikari, aren't you? The good girl 
        is loved differently than us.

Shinji: Don't argue now.

Asuka:  You're always such a smug-looking girl.

Asuka:  (Kuu)

Asuka:  Hey, just 'cause you're favored doesn't mean you can make a fool 
        of me.

Rei:    I'm not making a fool of you. I'm not favored--I know that well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The staff pulls the entry plugs from Evas with ropes at the cage

Staff:  Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

Staff:  Roger. Termination signal plugs have been removed.

Gendo:  Okay. Prepare to insert entry plugs into all three Evas.

Staff:  But we have no pilots.

Ritsuko: Don't worry. I'm sure they will come.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka

Shinji: I can't open this door by hand.

Rei:    That can't be helped. Let's break out of the duct and move ahead 
        past it.

Asuka:  I shouldn't fight with First. She's the type of person who
        stops at nothing to achieve her aims. She's what is called
        self-righteous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo and the staff pull ropes

Staff:  Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

 *Ritsuko and Maya

Maya:   We're ready to insert the plug.

Ritsuko: We only have to wait for them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka crawl through a duct

Asuka:  Don't look forward for any reason. If you look, I'll kill you.

Shinji: Eh?

Asuka:  Idiot!

Shinji: Uh!

Asuka:  Jerk! Stupid!

Shinji: Uh!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya in the cage

Asuka:  I told you not to look.

Shinji: I can do nothing but look. If I can't see forward, I can't 
        advance...

 *Shinji and Asuka fall from the duct. Rei jumps down to stand on the floor.

Shinji & Asuka: (Wa, Uwaa!)

Shinji: Uh!

Asuka:  Ouch!

Shinji: Damn it!

Asuka:  Ah!

Shinji: Oh!

Ritsuko: It's you guys.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo at the cage

Gendo:  Be ready for each entry!

Staff:  Roger. Open the hatches manually.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji approaches Ritsuko

Shinji: The Evas?

Ritsuko: They're ready.

Shinji: How? Even though nothing works?

Ritsuko: By human hand. This idea was from the Commander.

Shinji: Father's.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo pulls the rope with the staff to open the door of the entry plug

Staff:  Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

Ritsuko: Because you would come here, Commander Ikari has been preparing 
        things for you.

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Entry plugs are inserted

Maya:   Insert the plugs.

Ritsuko: All are ready for activation with the auxiliary power sources.

 *Gendo, Ritsuko and Maya

Gendo:  Remove the first lock bolt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The staff break pipes with axes

Staff:  (yell)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Hydraulic locks are released

Operator: Release hydraulic locks 2 through 32.

Maya:   Pressure zero. Situation free.

 *Gendo and Ritsuko and Maya

Gendo:  All right. Everyone, remove the bindings by force.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas try to remove the bindings

 *Makoto cry through a speaker

Makoto: The target has halted just above us.

Ritsuko: Hurry the preperations!

Maya:   Emergency batteries have been installed in them.

Ritsuko: Well. They're ready. Launch!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas crawl throught a duct

Asuka:  I look too disgusting!

Rei:    We're getting to the pit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Eva-02 kicks and opens a door to a pit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas climb up the pit

Asuka:  Oh, my! I look so ugly again. (Ha!)

Rei:    Watch it! Dodge!

Asuka:  What? Oh! No! Uh!

 *Evas fall down

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas stop falling down

 *Angel put its solvent liquid through the pit

 *Evas escape to a tunnel

Rei:    The target is trying to directly invade Headquarters using a 
        strong solvent liquid.

Shinji: What shall we do?

Asuka:  We'll destroy it, of course!

Shinji: Sure, but how are you gonna do it? I dropped my rifle and the 
        batteries on our backs are empty. We'll able to move for no more 
        than three minutes.

Asuka:  I have a plan. Defense stays here, neutralizes the AT-field and
        also protects Offense from Angel's solvent liquid. Backup goes 
        down, picks up the dropped rifle and gives it to Offense. Offense 
        then destroys the target with a burst from the rifle.

Rei:    I see. I'll be Defense.

Asuka:  Sorry, but I'm doing it.

Shinji: But it's so dangerous.

Asuka:  That's the reason. I'll feel funny unless I get even with
        you for the last battle. Shinji is Offense. The good girl is
        Backup. All right?

Rei:    I understand.

Shinji: Uh!

Asuka:  Let's go! (Geehn)

Asuka: (N,n,n)

Shinji: Ayanami! Asuka, clear the way!

Asuka:  I've gotten even with you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator Misato is on Ryoji's shoulder

Misato: Damn it! Why doesn't it open?! It's an emergency! I've gotta go to 
        the toilet before I have an accident! Uh! Hey! I told you not to 
        look up!

Ryoji:  Okay, okay!

 *Power is recovered

 *The door opens

Misato: (Ya ra a) Hey! Ahhh!

Ryoji:  Oh. Oops....(Uwaa)

Ritsuko, Maya and Makoto: Huh...

Misato: (N, n, nn

Ryoji:  (N, nn)

Ritsuko: (n, nn)

Maya:   Dirty...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka lie on the hill

Shinji: It's ironic that without the artificial electric lights, the stars 
        are very beautiful.

Asuka:  But it doesn't feel as if any people live there. Look, I feel easy 
        with this.

Rei:    We fear darkness and, to survive, chase it away with flames.

Asuka:  Philosophy!

Shinji: For that reason I wonder if humans are special creatures. And so
        the Angels attack us.

Asuka:  What are you, stupid?! I can't see that they have any reasons 
        whatsoever!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Trailer:

Misato is frustrated by the elimination of Angels, and her past is revealed. 
However, an Angel attacking from the stratosphere makes everyone abandon 
all hope. Next time: "The worth of a miracle." Watch it all together.
