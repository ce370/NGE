-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryouji:         Katsuragi, it's me.
                I'm sure you're listening to this message after I have
                caused you a lot of trouble. Sorry.
                Please say "I am sorry" to Ritchan.
                And there's one more thing to trouble you with.
                I've been taking care of flowers.
                I'd be glad if you could water the flowers for me.
                Shinji-kun knows where they are.
                Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
                Don't hesitate. Go forward!
                If I can see you again, I will say the words that I could not
                say 8 years ago. Bye.

Misato:         A telephone which doesn't ring...

        On BUSINESS
        Sorry, but don't call me.

Shinji:         Misato-san's shutting herself up today, as usual.

        Authorized Personal ONLY
        If you enter without my permission, you shall die!

        Eintritt Verboter!

Shinji:         Asuka... she isn't coming back today?

-----------------------------------------

Hikari:         She doesn't go to school or home,
                she plays games all day.

Asuka:          Hikari, let's go to bed.

Hikari:         Yeah.
-----------------

Asuka:          Sorry, I'm inconveniencing you.

Hikari:         No, you're not.

Asuka:          I didn't win with Eva.
                I lost all my values at any places.
                I hate, I really hate, I hate everybody,
                though it's myself who I hate most.
                I... now I don't care about anything,
                I have nothing to do.

Hikari:         I think that you can do anything you want to.
                I don't blame you.
                I really think you've done well.

Asuka:          [weeping.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko:        Well, that child is gone.
                hmm, probably.
                Even cats die.
                Don't cry, grandma.
                Hmm, I will come home when I have time to.
                I haven't been to my mom's grave for three years.
                Next time, I will call you.
                OK, I have to go.

Ritsuko:        So, that cat died.

Seele:          It is impossible for us to retrieve Lancea Longini.

Seele:          Why did you use it?

Seele:          And about the Eva series, we don't have all
                of them scheduled.

Gendou:         The annihilation of the Angel was more important.
                There was no other way.

Seele:          No other way?  Your excuses should be more persuasive.

Seele:          The things you have done recently are too bold.

Gendou:         Fuyutsuki, I am in conference.
                Alright.

Gendou:         An Angel is approaching right now.
                We will finish this discussion at the next opportunity.

Seele:          If your chair remains.

Seele:          Ikari, are you going to betray Seele?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato:         I'll be there in 15 minutes.
                Launch Unit Zero from the 32nd gate.
                Set Unit Two as back-up.
                No, I have no right to cancel the freeze on Unit One.
                Bye.

Misato:         Angel confirmed visually... right?

------------------------------
Announce:       Unit Zero, move out! To the intercept position.

Makoto:         Unit Two, wait at the present position.

Gendou:         No, sortie.

Makoto:         Commander!

Gendou:         I don't care. It might be useful as a decoy, at least.

Makoto:         Y, Yes sir!

-----------------------------

Announce:       Unit two, be ready to sortie.

Asuka:          I am on board again, as usual.
                Oh, no.  Am I still attached to this?

Announce:       Unit Two, To the eighth gate.
                Move out, as soon as the launch position is determined.

Asuka:          Even if I sortie, all I can do is to disturb the others.

Announce:       Target approaching. Passing by the final defense line at Goura.

Asuka:          I don't care about anything, any more.

-----------------------------------------------------

Announce:       Target floating above Oowakudani Valley,
                Rotating at a fixed position.

Makoto:         Target's AT Field is still active.

Ritsuko:        Where have you been?

Misato:         I don't have an excuse.
                Present status?

Shigeru:        Still a stalemate.

Makoto:         Changing cyclically from pattern blue to orange.

Misato:         What does that mean?

Maya:           Magi indicates that it is impossible to tell.

Shigeru:        The data is insufficient to find an answer.

Ritsuko:        But that shape is, I am sure, not a fixed shape.

Misato:         Our side cannot attack first.

---------------------------------------------------

Misato:         Rei! We'll observe its status for a while.

Rei:            No. It's coming.

Misato:         Rei, accept battle!

Makoto:         NO! It's too late!

Shigeru:        Target has physically contacted Unit Zero.

Misato:         Unit Zero's AT Field?

Maya:           Developing, but being penetrated.

Ritsuko:        The Angel is trying to achieve first level contact
                with Unit Zero?

-----------

Maya:           Danger! Unit Zero's Bioparts are being penetrated.

Misato:         Eva Unit Two, Sortie! Have her rescue Rei, and provide cover.

-------------------------
Maya:           progressing, and penetrating further.

Ritsuko:        This is dangerous. 5 percent has already been bio-fused.
------------------

Misato:         Asuka, approach 300 more, and develop an AT. field,
                fire the palette gun aiming at the Target's back part.
                Alright?
                Eva Unit Two, Lift off!

Misato:         Move out! Asuka! What's wrong?
                Unit two's status?

Maya:           Impossible, Syncro ratio is under 10%.

Misato:         Asuka!

-------------------
Asuka:          It doesn't move, doesn't move.
-------------------

Misato:         Like this, she'll be a victim too.
                Retrieve her!
                Hurry!
---------------------

Rei:            Who? Me? Me within Eva.
                No, I feel someone else other than me.
                Who are you? An Angel?
                The being that we call an Angel?

Rei (Angel):   Don't you want to be unified with me?

Rei:            No.
                I am I.  Not you.

Rei (Angel):   Hmm, but you shall.
                It's too late.
                I give you part of my mind.
                I give you this emotion.
                Pain, see, your mind has pain.

Rei:            Pain? no, something different.
                Loneliness.
                Yes. loneliness.

Rei (Angel):    Loneliness?
                I don't understand.

Rei:            Do you hate being alone?
                We are many,
                though you hate being alone.
                That's called loneliness.

Rei (Angel):    That's your mind. Full of sadness.
                That's your own mind.
----------
Rei:            These are tears. It's me who is crying.

-------------------------
Misato:         Rei!

Gendou:         The freeze on Unit One is canceled, effective immediately.
                Sortie as soon as possible.

Misato:         Eh?

Gendou:         Sortie!

Misato:         Yes sir!

--------------
Asuka:          What's this? Last time, he didn't use that for me.

-------------------------
Misato:         Develop AT Field, Rescue Rei! Quickly!

Shinji:         Yes!

-----------------
Rei:            Ikari-kun!

Shinji:         Ah!

Rei:            This is my mind,
                which I wish to be unified with Ikari-kun.
                No!

Maya:           AT Field Reversed.
                Penetrated instantly!

Ritsuko:        To hold the Angel?

Misato:         Rei! abandon the Unit and escape!

Rei:            No, If I escape, the AT field will disappear.
                So, I won't.

Misato:         Rei, do you want to die?

Maya:           The core is collapsing, passing through the critical point.

People:         Ooh...

Shigeru:        Target has disappeared.

Misato:         This operation is finished...
                Move to the level one alert.

Makoto:         Understood. Move to Situation Yellow, immediately.

Misato:         Unit Zero's status?

Maya:           Entry plug ejection not recognized.

Misato:         Rescue the survivor.  Hurry!

Ritsuko:        You mean, if there is one.

Misato:         heeah...

Ritsuko:        This is top secret. Scavenge the plug.
                Dispose of the parts concerned.

Staff:          Understood.

Staff:          Do it immediately.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Seele:          At last we have defeated the Angels, up to 16th.

Seele:          Now there is only one Angel left,
                which is described in the Dead Sea Scroll of Seele.

Seele:          The promised time is close.
                The road has been long, with many casualties.

Seele:          Aye. After losing Lancea Longini, we lost Eva Unit Zero.

Seele:          That is sufficient reason to dismiss Ikari.

Seele:          He must understand why we returned Fuyutsuki alive.

Seele:          A new sacrifice is needed, against Ikari.

Seele:          And, the one must know the truth.

Misato:         Shinji-kun, I'm coming in.

Shinji:         Misato-san. The tears won't come out.
                I think I am sad, but tears never come out.

Misato:         Shinji-kun, all that I can do for you is this.

Shinji:         Stop it!
                No, Misato-san.

Misato:         Sorry.
----------

Misato:         Although he must be lonely, maybe he fears a woman.
                No, he fears communication with people.

Misato:         PenPen come here.

Misato:         I see, anybody will do.
                It's me who is lonely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Misato:         Hi, Hello, Eh? Really!
                Shinji-kun!

        The First Cranial Nerve

Announce:       Dr. Odani of First Internal Department,
                Dr. Odani, please contact the Second Conference Room
                immediately.

Shinji:         Ayanami!

        UP                  / Left Lentogen

Shinji:         I'm glad, You're alive!
                My father isn't here?
                Thank you! You saved me.

Rei:            What?

Shinji:         You saved me, by even abandoning Unit Zero.

Rei:            Oh, did I save you?

Shinji:         Yeah. Don't you remember it?

Rei:            No, I mean, I don't know that.
                I think, probably, I am the third.

-----------------------------------------------------------

        402 Ayanami

Rei:            Are these tears?
                I am seeing these for the first time,
                but it doesn't seem to me to be the first time.
                I, am I crying? Why am I crying?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Gendou:         That's right.
                Preserve the present status for the First Children.
                No need to capture.

Fuyutsuki:      Yet, if they find out Rei is alive,
                Chairman Kihl and the others will blame us.

Gendou:         I will present something else to the old men of Seele.
                There is no problem.

------------------------------------------------------------

Seele:          We wish to proceed peacefully.
                We do not wish you to suffer from insults anymore.

Ritsuko:        I don't feel any insult.

Seele:          A strong tempered woman.
                It is quite natural for Ikari to keep her close.

Seele:          However, it was none other than Ikari who presented you to us.

Seele:          Rejecting the interrogation of the pilot of Unit One,
                He presented you as her deputy, Dr. Akagi.

Ritsuko:        I am Rei's deputy?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        On BUSINESS
        Sorry, but don't call me.

------

Ryouji:         The way to the truth, which you wanted, was sent by
                36 other methods to you. But those will not reach you.
                The only one guaranteed is this capsule.
                This is all that I have.
                It is completely up to you how to use this.
                The passcode is our first memory.
                Bye, take care.

Misato:         I'm not upset anymore by the telephone that doesn't ring,
                since I received your mind.

----------------------------------

Seele:          Is Dr. Akagi's disposition acceptable?

Seele:          Different from Fuyutsuki.
                It's better for us to return her.

Seele:          She rendered remarkable service to the Eva series.
                She should be useful to us for a while.

Seele:          Aye. For the future of humanity.

Seele:          Regarding Evangelions, Eight of them are under construction.

Seele:          Four more have not.

Seele:          The disappearance of Third New Tokyo City will enhance
                the project.
                Hurry with the completion.
                The promised day will be that day.

----------------------------------
Shinji:         Hi, Hello.

Ritsuko:        Listen to me.
                You are free from secret service right now.
                You can go out immediately.

Shinji:         Ritsuko-san...

----------------------------------

Ritsuko:        mm?

Misato:         No good, without my pass.

Ritsuko:        I see. Kaji-kun arranged that?

Misato:         The secret of this place must be revealed before my eyes.

Ritsuko:        Alright. And this child will see it as well.

Misato:         Very well.

------------------------------------------------

Shinji:         This looks just like Ayanami's room.

Ritsuko:        Ayanami Rei's room.
                This is the place where she was born.

Shinji:         In this room?

Ritsuko:        Yes. Her birth place.
                Light and Water, which make up Rei's deep mentality,
                reflect the image of this place.

Misato:         Dr. Akagi, I did not come to see this.

Ritsuko:        I know. Misato.

----------------------------

Shinji:         Eva?

Ritsuko:        The first one. A failure. Disposed of 10 years ago.

Shinji:         The graveyard for Evas.

Ritsuko:        Nothing but a dumping ground.
                This is also the place where your mother disappeared.
                Probably you don't remember, but you were watching it,
                watching the moment when she disappeared.

Shinji:         Aha!

Misato:         Ritsuko!
---------------------------

Misato:         You say this is the core of dummy plug?

Ritsuko:        I'll show you the truth.

Shinji:         Ayanami Rei...
                Ah!

Misato:         You say Eva's dummy plug is,

Ritsuko:        Yes. These are about to be the core of the dummy system.
                This is the factory for manufacturing them.

Misato:         This is?

Ritsuko:        These are dummies.
                And nothing but parts for Rei.
                Humans found a god, and thus, tried to obtain it.
                As a result, humanity was punished. That was 15 years ago.
                The god that they found vanished.
                However, they tried to revive the god themselves.
                It was Adam. A human was made from Adam to be
                close to the god.
                That is Eva.

Shinji:         Human?
                Is that a human?

Ritsuko:        Yes, that's a human.
                Eva, which did not have a soul ab initio,
                now that has a human soul.
                All of these are salvaged.
                However the vessel which truly contains a soul is Rei.
                Only she has a soul.
                None of the other vessels have a soul.
                There was nothing within the room of Gaff.
                These Rei-like things here do not have a soul.
                Nothing but vessels.
                So I will destroy them, because I hate them.

Misato:         Do you know what you're doing?

Ritsuko:        Yeah, I know. Destruction.
                These are not human, but human shaped things.

The town vanished, friends have left. Depressed Shinji, to whom a
boy smiles.  Into the boy's agreeable smile, like wind, Shinji is going
to melt.  But they are destined for tragedy.

Boy:            Don't you feel that way? Ikari Shinji-kun.

Misato:         No one looks at me.

Misato:         What shall I do, Mom?

Shinji:         You betrayed me!

Gendou:         Or to lead into the destruction?

Misato:         I can no longer care how others see me.

Boy:            You are the same as me.
