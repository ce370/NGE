Gendou: Yes, I've already made arrangements with the Committee about
        that problem. The cargo left port at Sasebo yesterday and is 
        currently on the Pacific.

---------------------------

Kensuke: A MIG 55D transport helicopter! I never thought I'd get a
        chance to fly on one! It's great to have friends, isn't it,
        Shinji?

Shinji: Eh?

Misato: I think it's stuffy being in the same mountain day after day,
        so I asked all of you on this date.

Touji:  Eh! Then this is a real date with Misato-san?
        Misato-san, I bought this cap just for today.

Shinji: So, where are we headed?

Misato: We'll be cruising the Pacific ocean on that gorgeous ship!

Kensuke: Wow! 5 carriers and 4 battleships! A cool fleet! Yeah, it's
        good to have friends...

Touji:  That ship's "gorgeous"?

Kensuke: You bet it's gorgeous!
        That's the regular carrier "Over the Rainbow," the pride of
        the U.N. forces.

Shinji: The ship is huge!

Misato: I wonder why such a relic is still afloat?

Kensuke: No, no, it's just vintage, pre-Second Impact.

-----------------

Captain: Hell! How presumptuous can she act, bringing a power socket for 
        the brats' toy?

Kensuke: Wow! Great, great, great...! Too great! If you're at all a man, 
        you've gotta weep at such a sight! Great...!

Touji:  Hey, wait! Wait!

Shinji: fwaaa...

Misato: AAAH...

Touji:  Damn it, stop! Stop!

Asuka:  Hello, Misato. How are you?

Touji:  Oh, no!

Misato: As well as ever. You've grown tall, haven't you?

Asuka:  Yeah! And not just taller--my figure has filled out, too.

Touji:  gggg...

Misato: Let me introduce you--this is the exclusive pilot of Evangelion 
        Unit Two, the Second Children, Soryu Asuka Langley.

lit.tr: (slap!) Episode 8 (slap!) "Asuka (slap!) comes to Japan"
eng.ti: Episode 8 "Asuka Strikes!"
-----------------------

Touji:  What did you hit me for?!

Asuka:  Payment for the view. You don't think it's cheap?

Touji:  Huh? Then I'll show you the same thing!

Asuka:  What are you doing!

Asuka:  So, which is the much-discussed Third Children?
        Don't tell me it's THAT boy?

Misato: No, this one.

Asuka:  Hmm... He seems rather dull...
------------------------

Captain: Ah, I thought you were these kids' Boy Scout leader, but I 
        guess I was mistaken.

Misato: Thank you for understanding, Captain.

Captain: Ah, no, no. Thank _you_ for bringing me even more children to
        take care of after so long a time.

Misato: We appreciate your assistance with the marine transport of Eva
        Two. Here are the specifications for the emergency power socket.

Captain: Ha! I'd never accept a request to run that doll on the sea in
        the first place!

Misato: Just think of it as a fall back in case of emergency.

Captain: It's against such emergencies that the Pacific fleet is
        supposed to guard! When did the U.N. turn us into bloody cargo
        haulers?

Kensuke: WOW,  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREEEEAAAAAAT, 
        WOW,  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, HA!

First Officer: I believe it was just after a certain organization was
        established.

Captain: Guarding a toy! What a grand assignment for the entire Pacific
        fleet!

Misato: Considering Eva's importance, it still seems lacking.
        Well, please sign these forms.

Captain: Not yet. At the request of the 3rd Branch in Germany, both Eva
        Two and its pilot are under the command of this fleet. I won't
        allow you to just do as you please!

Misato: Then when will you relinquish command?

First Officer: After unloading the cargo at Shin-Yokosuka.

Captain: We're in charge of anything on the sea. Follow orders without
        question.

Misato: Yes, I understand. In an emergency, however, please don't
        forget that Nerv's authority exceeds yours.

Touji:  She's cool!

Shinji: She's acting like Ritsuko-san...

Ryouji: You're as gallant as always...

Asuka:  Kaji-senpai!

Ryouji: Hi!

Misato: WOW! HA!

Captain: Kaji-kun! I can't seem to rememver inviting you to the bridge!

Ryouji: Sorry about that.

----------------

Misato: Then if you'll excuse us, we will leave. Please do your best 
        transporting everything to Shin-Yokosuka.

Touji:  Wasn't this a date?

Kensuke: GREAT! TOO GREAT!

----------------------

Captain: Shit! Those kids are gonna save the Earth?

First Officer: Times change. I heard the Assembly has put their hopes
        on that robot.

Captain: On that toy? Idiots! If they have the money to pay for that,
        they should be paying us more!

----------------------

Misato: What are you doing here?!

Ryouji: Accompanying her. I'm on a business trip from Germany.

Misato: I'm getting careless... I should have expected this situation...

Misato & Asuka: Hey, don't push!

Ryouji & Touji: We can't help it!

----------------------

Announcement: Squadron 3, take off as scheduled. Squadron 7, on duty
        to second deck...

Ryouji: Are you seeing anyone?

Misato: And that has something to do with you?

Ryouji: Oh, you wound me... 

Shinji: What?

Ryouji: Are you living with Katsuragi?

Shinji: Umm, yes.

Ryouji: Tell me, is she still so wild in bed?

Misato: Wh-- wh-- what are you implying!

Ryouji: She hasn't changed, Ikari Shinji-kun?

Shinji: Um, yes. Ah, how do you know my name?

Ryouji: It's no wonder I know you. You're famous in my circle--the
        Third Children who used Eva in combat without training.

Shinji: I got lucky.

Ryouji: That luck is a part of your destiny--it's your talent.
        Well, see you later.

Shinji: Okay.

Misato: This has to be a bad joke. No, a nightmare...

------------------------------
Ryouji: What do you think of Ikari Shinji-kun?

Asuka:  A dull boy! That's the great Third Children? I'm disappointed!

Ryouji: But without training, in actual combat his synchro-rate still
        easily exceeds 40 percent.

Asuka: That can't be true! 

-------------------------------

Touji:  That captain is the sort of person I hate!

Misato: He's a proud man. He can't help but be cynical towards us.

Shinji: He seems to be rather lively... Kaji-san, I mean.

Misato: He's always been like that, the iiidiot!

Asuka:  Third Children!

Shinji: What?

Asuka:  Come with me.

----------------------------------

Shinji: Hmm, Unit Two is red. I didn't expect that.

Asuka:  That's not the only difference. 

----------------------------------
Asuka:  After all, Units Zero and One are prototypes, test models in the 
        development process. The fact that it synchronized with you, an 
        untrained boy, is good proof of that. However, Unit Two is not 
        the same. This is a true Evangelion, the first on Earth built 
        for actual combat, the official model.

Shinji: Ah, what's happening?

Asuka:  Shock wave in the water...! 

Shinji: Ah!

Asuka:  Something exploded nearby.

------------------------------------

Asuka:  gggg...

Shinji: What's that...?! Is that... an Angel?

Asuka:  Is that a real...?

Shinji: What do I do? I've got to get back to Misato-san.

Asuka:  A chance!

EVANGELION EPISODE: 8

-------------------------------------

Announcement: All ships, check distances between other ships, and avoid 
        motion.

First Officer: Status report!

Voice:  (???), sinking. Titus Andronicus, still can't confirm the
        target!

Captain: Damn it! What's going on?!

Misato: Hi, Nerv Delivery!  You ordered data on and countermeasures
        against this invisible enemy, right?

Captain: In battle! Authorized personnel only!

Misato: From what I can tell, this must be an Angel attack.

Captain: All ships, fire at will.

Misato: That's useless.

---------------------------

Ryouji: That kind of attack won't penetrate its AT-Field.

---------------------------

Misato: Funny! Why's the Angel here? Did it come for Unit Two?

---------------------------

Shinji: Hey, where are we going?

Asuka:  Hey!  Wait here a second.

Shinji: What's she doing...?

----------------------------
Asuka:  Don't peep, you jerk!

Shinji: Sorry!

Asuka:  Why are boys such perverted idiots!

Shinji: Ah!

Asuka:  Asuka, let's go.

---------------------------

Captain: Why won't it sink?

Touji:  I knew it--only Eva can beat it.

Captain: mmmm...

--------------------------

Shinji: WOW!

Asuka:  Hey, let's go!

Shinji: Eh?

Asuka:  You have to come with me, too!

--------------------------

Shinji: Hey, why are we changing into plug suits?

Asuka:  Are you stupid? I'm gonna beat it with my Unit Two.

Shinji: That's going too far. What about Misato-san's permission?

Asuka:  I'll get permission after I win.

---------------------------

Asuka:  Here I go--now you'll see how skillful my piloting is.

Shinji: MM?

Asuka:  Just don't disturb me.

---------------------------

Misato: Curious... It seems to be looking for something.

---------------------------

Ryouji: I never expected an Angel attack here. This isn't like you said 
        it would be.

Gendou: Unit Two is there in case this happened, and I added a second pilot
        as a reserve. If the worst happens, escape by yourself.

Ryouji: I know.

----------------------

Asuka:  Erst Erfu"llung, Anfang der Bewegung, Anfang des
        Nervenanschlusses, Also lo"se sie es von links kleidung,
        Single start!

Shinji: An error? What happened?

Asuka:  Thought noise. I told you not to disturb me.

Shinji: What did I do?

Asuka:  You think in Japanese, right? Just think in German.

Shinji: All right... Ba-- baumkuuhen...

Asuka:  Idiot! Fine, stop trying. Switch the base thought language to
        Japanese.

Asuka:  Evangelion Unit Two, start!

----------------------------
Voice:  Message received from Othero: Evangelion Unit Two is starting.

Misato: Nice, Asuka!

Captain: No, halt the start sequence. Reset it!

Misato: I don't care! Asuka, launch!

Captain: What?! Both Eva Two and its pilot are under our control.
        I won't relinquish command to you!

Misato: What are you talking about? This is an emergency!
        The official arrangements don't matter!

Captain: Oh! No! Leave, leave!

Misato: No! Hey! Ah!

First Officer: You aren't serious? Unit Two is still carrying B-equipment.

Misato: Eh?

------------------

Shinji: If this falls into the sea, it's over.

Asuka:  And if it doesn't fall, we're fine!

-------------------

Misato: Shinji-kun, are you there?

Shinji: Yes.

Captain: Kids! Two kids...

Misato: Can I examine...

Misato: Asuka, take off!

-------------------

Shinji: Coming!

Asuka:  Go!

-------------------

Crews:  WOW!

-------------------

Asuka:  Where?

Shinji: That direction! 

-------------------

Shinji: Only 58 seconds left.

Asuka:  I know!
        Misato, prepare the emergency power socket on the deck.

--------------------

Misato: I understand.

Captain: What are you doing?

-------------------

Asuka:  Here we go! Jump!

Shinji: Jump?!

--------------------

Deck Officers: Run!

--------------------

Voice(male): Spare socket ready.

Voice(female): Direct reactor connection complete.

Announcement: Clear the flight deck.

Announcement: Prepare to receive Eva.

----------------------

First Officer: All personnel, brace for impact.

Captain: Nonsense!

-------------------------
Asuka:  Eva Unit Two, landiiing!

Shinji: Oh, no!

--------------------------

Misato: Oh!

--------------------------

Kensuke: What a waste!

Voice:  Target is rapidly approaching this ship!

--------------------------

Shinji: It's coming from portside, 9 o'clock.

Asuka:  Transfer to the external power source completed.

--------------------------

Shinji: But we have no firearms.

Asuka:  The Prog knife will do.

--------------------------

Shinji: The thing's damn big!

Asuka:  I kinda figured that.

-------------------------

Captain: What will you do?

Misato: Close range combat is the best way to defeat Angels.

-------------------------

Misato: Asuka, you did it!

Captain: This isn't a JOKE! The flight deck sustained heavy damage.

-------------------------

Asuka & Shinji: WOW!

-------------------------

Touji & Misato & Kensuke and others: WOW!

------------------------

Captain: It's fallen!

------------------------

Misato: Asuka--

-----------------------

Misato: --underwater battle is impossible with B-equipment.

Asuka:  You never know until--

----------------------

Asuka: --you try...

----------------------

Kensuke:What a waste...

Misato: Cable length?

First Officer: 1,200 remaining.

Captain: What will you do?

Misato: We can deal with it.

-------------------------

Asuka: mmmm...

Shinji: We must deal with it.

------------------------

Misato: Out of cable. Brace for shock.

-------------------------

Asuka:  Damn it!

-------------------------

Voice:  Eva missed the target.

Kensuke: Change disks...

Kensuke: Ah...! A Forge 38 Advanced!

------------------------

Ryouji: Hey, Katsuragi!

Misato: Kaji!

Ryouji: I've something to deliver, so I'll be leaving now...

------------------------

Misato: Oh, no!

-----------------------
Ryouji: Take off!

Ryouji: So, do your best, Captain Katsuragi!

-----------------------

Touji:  He escaped.

Voice:  Target again approaching Eva!

-----------------------

Shinji: It's coming again!

Asuka:  I'll beat it this time!

-----------------------

Asuka:  What?! It's not working!

Shinji: With B-equipment...

Asuka:  What can we do?

Shinji: What can we do?!

Asuka:  How sloppy! You're the Third Children, aren't you?

Shinji: Here it comes!

-------------------------

Asuka:  A m-- mouth?
        
Shinji: 'Cause it's an _Angel_...

-----------------------

Asuka & Shinji: WOW!

-------------------------

Voice:  Eva Unit Two has entered target's body.

Touji:  Does that mean Eva was eaten?!

--------------------------

Touji:  It's just like fishing...

Misato: Fishing...? Yes, fishing!

--------------------------

Shinji: Well, we're in another tight spot.

Asuka:  Shut up... Hey, get off me, jerk!

Shinji: But we have to free ourselves!

Misato: Asuka, can you hear me? 

--------------------------

Misato: Don't release it!

Asuka & Shinji: What?

--------------------------

Misato: Captain.

Captain:What?

Misato: I beg your cooperation.

--------------------------

Captain: Point blank shooting by the remaining two battleships?

Misato: Yes. We evacuate two battleships and sink them along the axial 
        line of the Umbilical Cable to form a trap.
        Meanwhile, Eva Unit Two will open the mouth of the target. The
        ships will then rush into the opening, fire with their bow
        turrets, and then self-destruct. That way the target will be
        totally defeated.

Captain: That's absurd!

Misato: Absurd, maybe, but I'd say not impossible.

Captain: I understand.

--------------------------------

Announcement: All personnel, abandon ship.  Repeat, all personnel abandon 
        ship.  Each (?) to the lifeboats.

---------------------

Captain: But what about Eva?

Misato: Don't worry about those two.

---------------------

Asuka:  Hey, don't operate my Unit Two without permission!

--------------------

Misato: Do you two understand the operation?

--------------------

Shinji: I'll do my best.

Asuka:  mmmm...

Misato: I'm counting on you.

Shinji: WOW.

----------------

Voice:  All ships have opened the Kingston valve and started sinking 
        toward Z-point.

---------------

Misato: Roger

Misato: Cable, reverse!

----------------

Asuka & Shinji: WOW

----------------

Voice:  Eva has started surfacing. 70 to contact.

-------------------

Asuka:  Hey, you're still touching my... Move!

Shinji: But if we can't open the mouth soon, we'll be destroyed, too.

--------------------

Voice:  60 to contact.

Misato: Status of Angel's mouth?

Captain: Still closed.

----------------------

Voice(female): Two battleships sinking toward target.

Voice(male): Eva surfacing. 50 to contact.

Shinji: No!

Asuka:  No time...

---------------------

Voice(female): Target passed the bottom of Tempest.

Misato: Hurry or you'll be too late!

----------------------

Asuka:  Don't think strange things!

Shinji: What?

Asuka:  Never mind, just concentrate.

Shinji: I know.
----------------------

Voice:  20 to contact.

Asuka & Shinji: mmmm...

----------------------

Voice:  15 to contact.

Shinji & Asuka: Open, open, open, open!

---------------------
Misato: Fire!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sign:   Shin-Yokosuka (AKA Odawara, pre-S.I.)

Ritsuko: That was some show!

Misato: I had to improvise the underwater combat.

Ritsuko: It's rare to hear you say that. Is this self-reflection?

Misato: Don't say it. We collected precious data.

Ritsuko: Right.

Ritsuko: Misato...

Misato: Hmm...?

Ritsuko: It truly is precious.
---------------------------
Touji:  P... Pair--look!

Kensuke: I feel sick!

Ritsuko: They boosted their synchronization values, didn't they?

Misato: In only 7 seconds. It might have been like a surge of strength in 
        a burning house...

Asuka:  Hey, where's Kaji-san?

Misato: He escaped earlier and must already have arrived at HQ.
        That bastard!

--------------------------

Ryouji: Well, that was an eventful journey!
        Was it caused by this, I wonder?

Ryouji: It has already been restored to this. Despite being held with the 
        durbakerite, I'm certain it's still alive.

Ryouji: That is the point of the Instrumental Project of Mankind, 
        isn't it?

Gendou: Yes. This is the first human being, ADAM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Touji:  Really, she was a disgusting girl, despite her lovely appearance.

Kensuke: Well, we'll never see her again.

Touji:  But, Sensei, you can't avoid meeting her because of your job.
        I really pity you.

Asuka:  Greetings. I am Souryuu Asuka Langley.

-----------------

Trailer

Having far from united minds, Asuka and Shinji are badly beaten by an
Angel so to make them act in total unison, Misato devises a plan.

Next time, "Within a moment, put hearts together."
           "Dance like you want to win"
Next time, of course, service, service!
