Neon Genesis Evangelion
Episode 24

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:          Mom! Mom!
                They selected ME!
                I'm an elite pilot, about to protect mankind.
                The best in the world.
                It's a secret to everybody.
                But I'll tell you, mom!
                Everybody is so nice to me,
                that I'm not lonely.
                I'm OK, even though I don't have father.
                Look at me! Me!
                Hey Mom!
--
Asuka:          Syncro rate Zero.
                I've no capacity to be the Second Children.
                I've no reason to exist.
                No one looks at me.
                Not daddy, mom, or anybody.
                There's no reason for me to live.

Staff:          You are Soryuu Asuka Langley?
--
Makoto:         Second section of Inteligence Division says
                the Second Children was captured alive.

Misato:         I see.
                They found her 7 days after they lost her.
                That isn't like them.

Makoto:         Maybe it was on purpose, then.
                The Planning Division is trying to make trouble for us.

Misato:         It could be.
                (And, today, the Fifth will arrive to replace Asuka.
                The scenario is too prearranged.)
--
Shinji:         Ayanami Rei,
                It may be correct... that impression.
                My mom's ...
                Rei and my Mom...
                What is my Father doing for these two?

--
Ritsuko:        Commander Ikari,
                My cat died,
                which my grandma had been taking care of.
                I hadn't been taking care of it for a long time.
                Suddenly now, I cannot see it again.

Gendou:         Why did you destroy the Dummy System?

Ritsuko:        It's not the Dummy System, but Rei who I destroyed.

Gendou:         I ask you once more.
                Why?!

Ritsuko:        Now, I'm not happy even if you hold me.
                You can do anything you like to my body,
                as you did before.

Gendou:         I was disappointed by you.

Ritsuko:        Disappointed?
                You have neither expectations nor hopes for me.
                I have, nothing, nothing ...
                what shall I do, mom.?

--
Shinji:         Where has Asuka been?
                (What should I talk to her about?
                Tell her about Ayanami?)

--
Shinji:         (Touji and Kensuke lost their houses here and went
                away somewhere.
                No friends, I have no friends here.
                No one.
                I don't want to see Ayanami.
                I lost the courage to see her.
                How should I act with her?
                Asuka, Misato-san, Mom,
                What Shall I do? What!

A boy:          (humming Beethoven's "Ode to Joy")
                A song is good!

Shinji:         Eh?

A Boy:          A song brings us joy.
                A song is the highest culture that Lilims have created.
                Don't you think so?
                Ikari Shinji-kun?

Shinji:         You know my name?

A Boy:          Everyone knows your name.
                Excuse me, but you had better be aware of your own position.

Shinji:         Is that so?
                Well, who are you?

A Boy:          I'm Kaoru.
                Nagisa Kaoru (Kaoru of the Seashore.)
                Just like you, I am one of the selected children.
                I am the Fifth Children.

Shinji:         Fifth Children!?
                You? Nagisa-kun?

Kaoru:          Call me "Kaoru," Ikari-kun.

Shinji:         Alright, call me Shinji.

Kaoru:          (Laugh)

Makoto:         Reportedly, the Fifth Children has just arrived.

--
Misato:         Nagisa Kaoru.
                The record of his life has already been deleted, like Rei.

Makoto:         One thing we know is that his birthday is the very day
                of Second Impact.

Misato:         The Committee sent him directly to us.
                He has something.

Makoto:         The information on the Fifth in the Malduk report is not
                permitted for publication.
                For this reason, I secretly investigated the data in
                the Inteligence division.

Misato:         Oh, you risked too much.

Makoto:         That risk was worth it.
                I know where Ritsuko-san is.
                How are you going to do the syncro-test for the Fifth?

Misato:         Today I don't have any plans to cheat.
                Let's see his ability.

--
Fuyutsuki:      Down 0.3 more.

Maya:           Yes sir.

Fuyutsuki:      Is there any mistake in this reading?

Makoto:         The testing system is operating normally.

Maya:           No data error detected by Magi.

Fuyutsuki:      It's amazing that this boy syncronizes with unit two
                before replacing the core.

Maya:           Yet, I can't believe it.
                I mean, it's impossible on this system.

Misato:         Nevertheless, it's a fact.
                We must accept the fact and then investigate the cause.

--
Kaoru:          You are, the First Children?
                Ayanami Rei.....
                You are the same as me.

Rei:            Who are you?

--
Fuyutsuki:      I hear that the Fifth boy contacted Rei.

Gendou:         Is that so?

Fuyutsuki:      Magi are doing their best to scan the data on the Fifth.
--
Misato:         Still, we don't yet known what he really is.
                What is he, that boy?

--
Penpen:         quaquqaa

Misato:         Shinji-kun has not returned.
                I am disqualified as his guardian.

--
Announce:       Central Dogma is being opened now.
                Use 3d route for the transfer.

Shinji:         hm?

Kaoru:          Hey.
                You were waiting for me?

Shinji:         Oh, no I did... I didn't mean to.

Kaoru:          Today is?

Shinji:         Well, the usual test was over and,
                I was going to have a shower before I went home.
                But, I don't want to go home these days.

Kaoru:          You have a house, or a home to go to.
                That fact makes you happy.  That's nice.

Shinji:         Is that so?

Kaoru:          I want to talk with you some more.
                May I go with you?

Shinji:         Eh?

Kaoru:          I mean to the shower.
                Aren't you going to shower?

Shinji:         Yeah...

Kaoru:          You mean "no"?

Shinji:         Oh, yes. I don't mean NO.
--
Kaoru:          You avoid contact of the first kind at all costs.
                do you fear to feel other people?
                Being ignorant of others, you will never be betrayed
                or hurt, though you will never escape from feeling sadness.
                A person cannot erase sadness forever.
                Everyone is alone.
                However, people can forget, and so they are able to live.

Shinji:         Oh!

Shinji:         It's time.

Kaoru:          It's over?

Shinji:         We have to go to bed.

Kaoru:          Together with you?

Shinji:         Ah... no, you are provided with your own, different room .

Kaoru:          Well, people always feel pain in their hearts.
                The heart is easy to wound, that's why living is painful.
                In particular, your heart is fragile like glass.

Shinji:         Me?

Kaoru:          Worthy of love.

Shinji:          Love?

Kaoru:          I mean, I love you.

--B PART---
Seele:          NERV, the system established to act under us of Seele.

Seele:          Founded to play our scenario.

Seele:          Now, it has been exclusively taken by one person.

Seele:          Aye. We must take it back.

Seele:          Before the day of promise.

Kihl:           Let NERV and Eva-series be as they should be.
                Ikari, you are responsible of betraying Seele.
--
Gendou:         The time remaining to us is short.
                And, now we don't have Lancea Longini that would prevent
                us from realizing our hopes.
                The final Angel will soon appear.
                When we erase that, our hopes will come true.
                Wait a little, Yui.
--
Rei:            Why am I here?
                Why am I still alive?
                For what?
                For whom?
                The Fifth children.
                He looks  something like me.
                Why?

--
Misato:         We are lucky because we live in the suburb of the city.
                You were not involved, I'm glad about that.
                Yet, next time, I cannot garantee that.
                So, you will be taken care of at Horaki-san's from tomorrow.
                So long, PenPen.

PenPen:         Quaa, quaquauu.

Misato:         (Sigh)

--
Kaoru:          Really, I should be on the floor.

Shinji:         Oh, you shouldn't. It's me who asked you to let me stay here.
                It's OK if I sleep here.

Kaoru:          What do you want to say?

Shinji:         Eh?

Kaoru:          You have something that you want me to hear.

Shinji:         I've experienced many things since I came here.
                I was at my teacher's before.
                Silent and calm days.
                I did nothing but exist.
                That was fine with me.
                I had nothing to do.

Kaoru:          You dislike people?

Shinji:         Well, I don't really care.
                Except for my father, who I hate.
                (Why am I talking about this kind of thing to Kaoru-kun?)

Kaoru:          (Laugh)

Kaoru:          (Sigh)

Kaoru:          I might have been born to meet you.
--
Misato:         Well? You've got HIS data?

Makoto:         Here you go.
                I borrowed this from First Lieutenant Ibuki without
                her permission.

Misato:         I am sorry for that I made you do something like a thief.
                What's this?

Makoto:         It's quite natural that Maya-chan cannot publish this.
                It's theorically imppossible.

Misato:         Hmm, yes.
                The mystery increases.
                He can arrange any syncro ratio freely, of his own will.
                We must do anything we can, without considering
                what others think.
--
Ritsuko:        You dared to come here.

Misato:         I have one thing to ask you.

Ritsuko:        This conversation is being recorded.

Misato:         I don't care.
                What is that boy, the Fifth?

Ritsuko:        Probably... the final messenger.
--
Kaoru:          Well, let's go.
                Come, Adam's alter ego, and the servant of the Lilim.

--
Makoto:         Eva Unit Two started!

Misato:         What the hell!
                Asuka...?

Shigeru:        ...in hospital room 303.
                It's confirmed.

Misato:         Then who is ...?

Maya:           It's unmanned.
                Entry plug has not been inserted.

Misato:         Unmanned?
                Isn't it the Fifth?

Makoto:         A.T. Field generation detected in Central Dogma.

Misato:         Unit 2?

Makoto:         No, Pattern is Blue.
                No doubt. It's an ANGEL!

Misato:         What?!

Misato:         An Angel?
                That boy?

Operator:       Target passing by the fourth level.
                Still descending.

Shigeru:        No good.
                Cannot disconnect the power supply to the Linear Motor Car.

Operator:       Target passing by the fifth lvel.

Fuyutsuki:      Close all bulkheads in Central Dogma!
                Anything to gain time.


Operator:       Close all levels in the direction of five o'clock.
                All personnel, Evacuate. All personnel, Evacuate.


Fuyutsuki:      Seele dared to send it directly to us.

Gendou:         The old man is trying to advance the schedule,
                using us.

--
Seele:          The final Angel has invaded Central dogma.
                Now descending.

Seele:          Just according to our schedule.

Kihl:           Ikari, you were our good friend and brother, sharing the same
                purpose; our collaborator who understood us.
                This is the last job.
                We hope you complete it, with Unit One.

--
Shigeru:        Armoured bulkheads broken through by Eva Unit Two.

Makoto:         Target passing the second level.

Gendou:         Eva Unit One will pursue!

Misato:         Yes Sir!

Gendou:         Use any means.
                Do not allow the target to invade Terminal Dogma.


Misato:         But why is the Angel using Unit Two?

Fuyutsuki:      Is he trying to unite withUnit Two?

Gendou:         Or to lead to destruction.

--
Shinji:         NO NO NO, IT MUST BE A LIE!
                Kaoru-kun is an Angel?
                That MUST BE LIE!

Misato:         It's true. Accept the facts.
                Sortie, OK?

--
Kaoru:          Shinji hasn't come yet.

--
Operator:       Eva Unit One, descending through ROUTE 2.
                Pursuing the target.
--
Shinji:         You betrayed me!
                You betrayed my heart!
                You betrayed me like my father!

--
Shigeru:        Unit One reached the fourth layer.
                Contacting the target.
--
Shinji:         You're here.

Kaoru:          I've been waiting for you.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun..

Shinji:         Asuka! Sorry!

Kaoru:          Evae, factae de Adamo, the beings detested by humans.
                Still, the Lilims are trying to survive by using them.
                I can't understand why.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun STOP!
                I don't see Why.

Kaoru:          Eva is made of the same body as me.
                Because I am also the natus de Adamo.
                When the unit does not have a soul, I can unite.
                The soul of this unit is shutting itself up now.

Shinji:         A.T. Field!

Kaoru:          Yes. You Lilims call it so.
                The holy region that must not be invaded by anyone.
                The light of mind.
                You, Lilims, are aware of that.
                Aware that the A.T. Field is the wall of mind that everyone has.

Shinji:         I don't understand that! Kaoru-kun!

Shinji:         GU,GAAAAA,,
--
Operator:       Both Eva units have reached the last level.

Operator:       20 until the Target reaches Terminal Dogma.

Misato:         When something happens, after the signal from
                Unit One disappears...

Makoto:         I know.
                You are going to self destruct this place.
                It's better than letting Third Impact take place.

Misato:         I'm sorry.

Makoto:         Not at all, I can die with you.

Misato:         Thanks.
--
Kaoru:          The destination of people?
                The hope of people is the thread of sadness.

--
Misato:         What's that?

Makoto:         The strongest A.T. Field we've ever seen.

Shigeru:        Light waves, electromagnetic waves and particles are shut out.
                We can't monitor anything.

Misato:         That's a Barrier?

Maya:           The Target, Eva Units Two and One, all missing.
                Cannot connect to the pilot.

--
Shinji:         gggggg,
                Kaoru-kun!

Shinji:         Wait!

--
Shigeru:        Final safety system released.

Makoto:         Heaven's Door is opening.

Misato:         The Angel has arrived?
                Hyuuga-kun!
--
Shinji          WOW!
                What!
--
Misato:         Status?

Makoto:         It's an A.T.Field.

Shigeru:        Another A.T. Field, similar to the previous one,
                has been generated around Terminal Dogma.

Maya:           Invading the Barrier.

Misato:         Does that mean another Angel?

Shigeru:        Impossible.
                No, cannot confirm.
                AH! I mean, it vanished.

Misato:         Vanished?
                An Angel?

Kaoru:          Adam, our mother being.
                Those born from Adam must return to Adam,
                even anihilating humanity?
                No! It's different.
                This is Lilith.
                I see. I understand, Lilim.

Kaoru:          Thank you Shinji-kun.
                I wished you to keep Unit Two.
                Otherwise, I might have lived with her.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun, why?

Kaoru:          I've been destined to live forever, even if
                humanity is annihilated as a result.
                However, I am able to die.
                To be or not to be.  It makes no difference to me.
                My death is the only absolute liberty.

Shinji:         What, What are you talking about?
                Kaoru-kun! I don't understand what you're talking about!
                Kaoru-kun!

Kaoru:          My last words.

Kaoru:          Now, please erase me.
                Otherwise you will be erased.
                The life that escapes the time of annihilation,
                and that obtains the future, is only one.
                And, you are not the one who must die.
                All of you need the future.
                Thank you. I am glad to have met you.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun, said "I love you."
                To me!
                For the first time, for the first time I heard those words.
                He looked like me.
                He looked like Ayanami.
                I loved him.
                Kaoru-kun should have been the one to survive.
                He was much better than I am.
                He should have survived.

Misato:         No.
                A surviver only needs the will to survive.
                He wished to die.
                He abandoned the will to live, and depended on false hope.
                You were not wrong.

Shinji:         You are cold, Misato-san.
