Avant title


        It was in 2015 A.D.

------------

        The third Angel

------------

        Sachiel's attack

------------

        The performance of conventional weapons
        against Angels
        was seen to be insufficient.

------------

        The U.N. force,
        having failed to carry out the plan,

------------

        transfered all the authority to command
        to the special institute NERV.

------------

        The same day midnight,
        the Angel arrived
        above NERV headquarters.

------------

        The same day, acquired was

------------

        The Third Qualified Child,

------------

        Ikari Shinji,

------------

        who was accepted to pilot

------------

        Evangelion Unit One
        and sortied for the first time.

------------

        NERV
        experienced its first actual battle,

------------

        the first battle in Tokyo-3.

------------

        Eva Unit One
        took damage to the head component
        and lost control.

------------

        Complete silence.

------------

        Afterwards,

------------

        RUNNING WILD.

------------

        "Urban combat in Tokyo-3"
        interim report.
        The commanding officer:
        Chief of Strategy Captain Katsuragi Misato.

Misato: Although the resultant damage was terribly large,

------------

        The A.T. Fields of

Misato: the challenge to a first battle against an unknown target
        by an inexperienced boy,

------------

        the third Angel and Unit One
        were detected.

Misato: and the fact that he carried out said challenge
        are indeed admirable accomplishments for Ikari Shinji.

------------

        Unit One
        eroded the target's A.T. Field.

Misato: However, for the Strategic section, it was a hard
        battle that further revealed more problems and many
        points requiring improvement.

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        Intercept installation, slight damage.
        Eva Unit One, middle scale damage.

------------

        The sufferers in the incident
        were not made public.

------------

        Excerpted from Suzuhara Touji's notes/diary

Touji:  Sis is in primary school, her second year.
        She got hurt in that snafu'd incident,
        but it ain't 'cuz of the enemy. No, it's 'cuz o' the
        nutty robot on our side.
        There's no way I can fogive such a damn-fool pilot.
        I wanna make those adults who made the robot feel Sis's
        pain and my anger...

------------

        The fourth Angel

------------

        Shamusiel's
        attack

------------

        At that time,
        the performance ratio of
        the surface-to-air intercept system:
        48.2%

------------

        The operation ratio of the
        Tokyo-3 battle formation:
        96.8%

------------

        Douki Hikari's notes/diary (exerpts)

Hikari: Since I'd often experienced evacuation training together
        with my classmates, this was just like an everyday matter.
        I did not truly realize the full extent of the situation.
        The boys were making noise as if they were on a school excursion
        and us girls were not afraid of anything.

------------

        The Angel
        arrived above Toyko-3.

------------

        The second battle in Tokyo-3.

------------

        Despite an accidental severing of
        the power-supply,

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        NERV obtained a sample
        of an Angel retaining its original shape,

------------

        yet the final report
        of the analysis
        was never published.

------------

        The Fifth Angel

------------

        Ramiel's attack

------------

        Against
        this difficult opponent,

------------

        Captain Katsuragi's proposition,
        Operation Yashima,
        was approved.

------------

        The First Qualified Child

------------

        The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit Zero

------------

        Ayanami Rei

------------

        sortied on the unsealed
        Eva Unit Zero for the first time.

------------

        The same day midnight,
        a component of the Angel
        invaded the Geofront.

------------

        NERV
        executed Operation Yashima.

------------

        Excerpted from Aida Kensuke's personal material

Kensuke:Ikari says nothing, but I am sure at that time, Unit Zero
        protected Unit One with her life against the enemy's
        accelerated-particle-cannon attack.
        I am certain about this, and
        it is due to a single reason.
        It's Ayanami.
        I have the impression that Ayanami regards herself as
        having a very tenuous existence.

------------

        Operation Yashima,
        successful.

Kensuke:It's different from pessimism,

Kensuke:But she already has something like that.

------------

        Eva Unit Zero, heavily damaged.

-----------

        However,
        the pilot survived.

Kensuke:She seems more matured than the rest of us who are 14 years old.

------------

        The sixth Angel

------------

        Gagiel

------------

        was encountered.

Committee:This incident is slightly outside the scenario.

Ikari:  Yet the result was within the predicted range.
        It's possible to revise.

------------

        The Second Qualified Child

------------

        The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit Two

------------

        Souryu Asuka Langley

------------

        sortied on Eva Unit Two
        for the first time.

------------

        With a close-range battle on the sea

------------

        and

------------

        the first underwater combat

------------

        in the battle around the Old Ito region,

------------

        Angel, annihilated.


Committee: In the battle, the U.N. Navy lost one third of its entire fleet.

Committee: The ships lost are those of your country.
        It is negligible.

Committer:Well, yes. It was quite fortunate that once again that the 
        damage was minimal.

------------

        The Seventh Angel

------------

        Israfel's
        Attack

------------

        It had the capability of
        separation and combination.

------------

        However,
        By a synchronized, two-point heavy assault
        by Eva Units One and Two,

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        The Eighth Angel

------------

        Sandarphone

------------

        Discovered inside the
        crater of Mt. Asamayama.

------------

        NERV
        ordered Special Command A-17

------------

        and carried out the capture operation
        under ultimate priority conditions.

------------

        The target was momentarily imprisoned
        in an electro-magnetic light wave cage.
        But...

------------

        the electro-magnetic barrier was broken.
        The operation was aborted.

------------

        The objective of the operation
        was changed to
        Angel annihilation.

------------

        Eva Unit Two
        carried out the operation.

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        Eva Unit Zero was fully restored from damage
        and had upgrades completed.

------------

        It was returned to operational status.

------------

        The Ninth Angel

------------

        Matriel's
        attack

------------

        By the first simultaneous
        operation of three Eva Units

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        The Tenth Angel

------------

        Tzachqiel's
        attack

------------

        Against the target dropping
        from stratosphere,

------------

        through direct interception
        by three Eva Units,

------------

        Angel, annihilated.

------------

        The Eleventh Angel

------------

        Its attack is not currently being acknowledged.

------------

        A rumour states NERV headquarters
        was directly invaded.

Committee: That is very bad.

------------

        The Instrumentality of Man Committee,
        Special Meeting

Committee: Too early.

Committee: Well, yes. It does not agree with the prediction that an Angel
        should invade the headquarters of NERV.

Committee: In addition to that, you allowed it to invade Central 
        Dogma.

Committee: If contact had taken place, the entire plan would be in vain.

Ikari:  The report to this committee was false.
        There's no truth behind the Angel's invasion.

Committee: Then, Ikari, you're saying, the Eleventh Angel's
        invasion is not fact?

Ikari:  Yes.

Committee: You should watch your speech with care, Ikari-kun.
        A perjurer before this committee shall die.

Ikari:  I will allow you to investigate the records of Magi.
        Nothing concerning the incident was recorded.

Committee: Don't make us laugh!
        Concealing facts is one of your specialities.

Ikari:  The time schedule is proceeding according to the description in 
        the Dead Sea Scroll.

Committee: All right. This time, we won't accuse you of crime and 
        responsibility. However, you don't have to write a new scenario.

Ikari:  I understand.
        Let all things go according to Seele's scenario.

        Episode: 14
        WEAVING A STORY

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Rei:    Mountain. Heavy are the mountains,
        Something that changes through ages.
        Sky. Blue sky. Something visible, something invisible.
        Sun. Something unique.
        Water. Something agreeable. Commander Ikari.
        Flowers. Many of them alike, many of them useless.
        Sky. Red, red sky. Red colour. Red colour that I hate.
        Water flow. Blood. The smell of blood. A woman that does not bleed.
        Made from the red soil are humans.
        Made by Man and Woman are humans.
        Town. Something that humans made.
        Eva. Something that humans made.
        Humans are what? Something that God made.
        Humans are things which humans made.
        The things I possess are my life and mind.
        The vessel of a mind. Entry plug, the throne of a soul.

Rei:    Who is this? This is me.
        Who am I? What am I? What am I? What am I? What am I?

Rei:    I am myself. This object is me, the figure which forms me.
        This is the me that is visible, though it feels as if this is not me.
        A strange feeling.
        My body seems as if it is melting.
        I cannot see myself. My figure is fading away.
        I am aware of someone else.
        Who is there before me?
        Ikari-kun.
        I know this person. Major Katsuragi.
        Dr. Akagi.
        People, my classmates.
        The pilot of Unit Two.
        Commander Ikari.
        Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

Ritsuko: So, Rei, how is being in Unit One for the first time?

Rei:    It smells of Ikari-kun.

------------

        The first mutual compatibility test.
        Examinee: Ayanami Rei

------------

Ritsuko:The synchro-ratio is almost the same as that with Unit Zero.

Maya:   A similar personal pattern is shared between Unit Zero and Unit One.

Ritsuko: That is why synchronization is possible.

Maya:   Error plus minus 0.03.
        Harmonics are regular.

Ritsuko:No detectable problems in the compatibility between Rei and Unit One.

Ritsuko: Okay, test complete. Rei, your job is over.

Rei:    Yes.

------------

        The 87th Unit synchronization test.
        Examinee: Souryu Asuka Langray

------------

Announce: Data-bank of Unit Two, complete.

Announce: Harmonics regular.

Announce: Pilot, nothing abnormal.

Asuka:  Obviously.

------------

        The first mutual compatibility test.
        Examinee: Ikari Shinji

------------

Ritsuko:Personal data of Unit Zero?

Maya:   Rewriting already completed. Currently verifying.

Ritsuko:Examinee's status?

Staff:  Slightly strained, but no problems in the nerve pattern.

Misato: He's in Unit Zero for the first time, and since it's a different Eva,
        that's reasonable.

Asuka:  He's a fool! He should relax and ignore stuff like that.

Misato: He's not a kid to do that, not Shinji-kun.

Asuka:  I know. That's why he's a fool.

Misato: (laughs)

Asuka:  By the way, about the other two's Unit compatibility test,
        won't I have to participate in it?

Misato: You woudn't want to use anything other than Unit Two.

Asuka:  Yeah, obviously I wouldn't.

Misato: I've never heard anything about Unit Two's compatibility...

Announce:Entry started.

Announce:LCL injected.

Announce:Start first stage connection.

Ritsuko:Shinji, how do you feel in the entry plug of Unit Zero?

Shinji: I feel something strange.

Maya:   Do you feel any incompatibility?

Shinji: No... I mean, it smells of Ayanami...

Asuka:  What's he smelling? He's just perverted!

Announce:Data received. Verifying...

Announce:Pattern green.

Announce:Main power-supply connection complete.

Announce:All restraints nominal.

Ritsuko:Roger. The mutual compatibility test will proceed to the second 
        stage.

Maya:   Unit Zero entering the second contact.

Misato: How is it?

Ritsuko: As I expected, a smaller synchro-ratio than with Unit One.

Maya:   Harmonics all in normal position.

Ritsuko:But these are good readings.
        This means we can carry out the plan.

Maya:   The Dummy system, you mean?
        Senapi, I dare say that I'm not really...

Ritsuko:I understand why you don't want this.
        However, preparation is always necessary in order for one to live.

Maya:   I respect you, senpai, and I will do my job,
        but I'm not entirely convinced.

Ritsuko:One with mysophobia always feels difficulty in living among people.
        When you get dirty, you will discover this.

Announce:Third connection started.

Announce:Self-psycho-graph, stable.

Asuka:  What's it like, Shin-chan! Mama's breast? Or inside the womb?

Ritsuko:Asuka! No interruptions! Noise would penetrate.

Asuka:  Yeah, fine.

Asuka:  What the hell? Everyone pampers Shinji...

Ritsuko: A10 Nerve connection started.

Announce: Harmonics Level plus 20.

Shinji: Ah, what's this?
        Something's directly entering my mind. What is it?
        Ayanami? Ayanami Rei? It's Rei, this impression is hers.
        Ayanami? Isn't it?

Misato: What's wrong?

Announce:Pilot's nerve-pulse is irregular.

Maya:   Psychological contamination taking place.

Ritsuko:Impossible! This plug depth could not trigger that.

Maya:   No, it's not from the plug. The invasion's from Eva.

Maya:   Unit Zero, out of control!

Ritsuko:Cut all circuits! Cut power-supply!

Announce:Eva switched to backup power source.

Announce:Still operatioinal.

Misato: Shinji's status?

Staff:  No carrier on the circuit. Monitoring is impossible.

Ritsuko:Unit Zero is rejecting Shinji-kun?

Maya:   No! Auto-ejection non operational.

Ritsuko:The same incident as last time?
        Is it trying to possess Shinji-kun?

Misato: Rei! Get back! Rei!

Announce:Unit Zero, 10 seconds to operation halt, 9, 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0

Announce:Unit Zero has ceased operation.

Misato: Rescue the pilot! Hurry!

Misato: No way! Did Eva just try to kill Rei?

-----------------------

Misato: Is this incident related to the last time it ran wild? 
        That incident with Rei?

Ritsuko: There is little I can say at the moment. The one thing I can
        currently say is that after returning the personal data of Rei to 
        Unit Zero, another synchronization test between Rei and Unit Zero 
        will be necessary.

Misato: As Chief of Strategy, I request that you do it immediately,
        before it interferes with our job.

Ritsuko:I understand, Major Katsuragi.

Ritsuko: Unit Zero must have tried to attack me.
        That must be it.

------------------------------

Shinji: Uh.

Radio:  The next astonishment in the world is a doggy who can calculate.
        Hi! Here you go, the genius doggy, Kanna-chan!
        ONE!
        Good greetings!
        Do you understand language?
        ONE!
        Oh, that's right!
        ONE!
        Then please solve this problem:
        325 minus 324 is
        ONE!
        Oh! Great! That is correct!

# Japanese dog barks "WAN, WAN" instead of "BOW WOW", thus "one one"

Shinji: No... I hate this ceiling.
------------

Staff:  Shinji-kun has recovered consciousness.
        No after-effects remain from the pollution.
        He himself remembers nothing.

Misato: Really...

-------------------------------------
Radio:  The problem of Nansha islands ...

Asuka:  Both Misato and Kaji-san tell me nothing.
        Shinji knows nothing.
        What kind of a girl is First?

--------------------------------------
Fuyuzuki:About that Angel's invasion which deviated from the plan.
        The Instrumentality of Man Committee found the facts and are pushing.
        They are ill-tempered people. To complain is their only job. 

Ikari:  All the trump cards are ours. They can do nothing.

Fuyuzuki:That does not mean you should irritate them.

Ikari:  Everything is going according to the scenario. There are no problems.

Fuyuzuki:What about Unit Zero's accident? That was not in my scenario.

Ikari:  It's not interfering.
        The synchro test between Rei and Unit Zero after that
        was successful.

Fuyuzuki:He's taking care of Rei too much. Ikari...

Fuyuzuki:What's the status of the Adam Project?

Ikari:  No problems. The delay is less than 2%.

Fuyuzuki:Then, how about Lancea Longini?

Ikari:  Going according to the plan.  
        The operation is being carried out by Rei.
