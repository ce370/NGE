Evangelion Episode 15

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Avant Title

Fuyuzuki:       Second and Third Lake Ashinoko.
                I don't want any more of them.
                Yesterday, A complaint came from Chairman Keel,
                directly to me.
                He was very upset.
                Towards the end he hinted at your dismissal.

Ikari:        Adam is going well.  As for the Eva project, we've begun
                work on the Dummy Plug.
                What are the old men of Seele complaining about?

Fuyuzuki:     The most important, The Human Instrumentality Project,
                is behind schedule.

Ikari:          All the projects are coupled together.
                There are no problems.

Fuyuzuki:       You also mean Rei?
                Alright.
                By the way, how shall we deal with that man?

Ikari:          Let him do as he likes.
                the same for the Marduk Institute.

Fuyuzuki:       We can make use of him for a while.

Woman:         It's me.

Ryouji:         Oh, is that you?

Woman:          Shannon Bio Inc. A foreign capitol Chemical company.
                It's been here for 9 years, with no changes for 9 years.
                Among the 108 enterprises connected to Marduk Institute,
                106 were dummies.

Ryouji:         So, you're saying this is the 107th?

Woman:          The company's registration record...

Ryouji:         You're going to say "look at the list of directors"

Woman:          You already know about that?

Ryouji:         I know most of the names.
                Marduk Institute, a consultative firm established
                directly under The Human Intstrumentality Committee
                in order to select the pilots of Evangelion.
                The form of the system has not been revealed.

Woman:          Your job is to spy on NERV. It's dangerous to
                disturb Marduk.

Ryouji:         Well, I can't seem to keep from investigating everything
                myself.

Answering Machine: Hello. This is Kaji's. I am out at the moment, but
                you can leave your name and message.

Asuka:          AH!  Help me Kaji-san! What are you doing,
                you pervert! AAAAAA!
                Phew.

Hikari:         What happened?

Asuka:          I've wanted Kaji-san to take me somewhere tomorrow, Sunday.
                I gave him a call, but he's been away for so long.
                These days, he's always out.

Hikari:         That means, you have nothing to do tomorrow.

Asuka:          It's regrettable, but true.

Hikari:         Then, I have a favor to ask you.

Asuka:          What is it?

Hikari:         I mean..

Asuka:          Oh! A date?

Hikari:         It's a friend of my sister Kodama.
                He said: "You must introduce her to me!"
                Please!

# Hikari's elder sister is named Kodama.
# Hikari's younger sister is named Nozomi.
# These are the names of Japan's bullet trains.
# Kodama (Local Express), Hikari (Super Express), Nozomi (Super-Super Express)

Touji:          Meeen!

# The word used when one hits with sword in Japanese Kendo swordmanship.
# "Men" originally meant the protector-mask, or simply a mask.

Shinji:         Oh!

Touji:          Do your job!

Shinji:         Sorry.

Hikari:         You should know your job is to clean the room!

Announce:       ... Synchro-position is normal.

Ritsuko:        Which dress will you wear tomorrow?

Misato:         Oh, you mean the wedding party?
                I wore that pink suit at Kiyomi's party.
                I just wore that navy blue dress at Kotoko's.

Ritsuko:        How about that orange one?
                You haven't used that recently.

Misato:         Oh, that one. There's a slight reason why...

Ritsuko:        Too tight?

Misato:         Right.
                Phew.
                Should I buy new one on the way home?
                It will cost a lot.

Ritsuko:        We've been invited around so frequently; the amount of
                gratuity is getting huge.

# The guest has to give a gratuity to the host couple in Japan.
# The amount is about 20,000 YEN (200 US$) or more.

Misato:         Shit! Every one is eager to marry before they reach
                thirty .

Ritsuko:        We don't want to be the last ones still single.

Ritsuko:        OK! Your work is finished.

Ritsuko:        You're done.

Asuka:          Always tests, tests. It's so boring!

Ritsuko:        By the way, Shinji-kun seems very depressed today.

Misato:         'cose of tomorrow.

Ritsuko:        Hmm... tomorrow.

---------------------------------------------

Shinji:         I am going to see my father tomorrow.
                What do you think I should talk about with him?

Rei:            Why do you ask me about something like that?

Shinji:         'cose you seemed to enjoy talking with my father the other day.

Shinji:         So, what kind of man is my father?

Rei:            I have no idea.

Shinji:         Is that so.

Rei:            Is it because you've wanted to ask that, that you've
                been staring at me since morning?

Shinji:         Yeah.

Shinji:         Oh, when we were cleaning the room today, when you were wringing
                the floorcloth.
                You looked like a mother then.

Rei:            A mother?

Shinji:         Yeah.
                Yeah, that was just like a mother's way of wringing.
                I bet you'll become a housewife.
                (Laugh).

Rei:            What do you say!

---------------------------------------------

TV:             Oh, no! It's you who said "we should seperate."

Misato:         I'm back.

TV:             .... maybe .....

Asuka:          Hi.

TV:             What are you saying, in a situation like this?
                I don't know about you, but I'm different from what I was
                in those days.

Misato:         Go to bed right now, because you have a date tomorrow.

TV:             Yet, I still love...

Asuka:          Yeah, with an MD student.
                Oh, I've got it. Hey, can I use that? Your lavender perfume.

Misato:         NO!

TV:             Once .... a woman cannot return to what she was.
                I cannot return to what I was in those days.

Misato:         Shit. You're stingy!

TV:             But I still love you.

Misato:         It's not for a child like you.
                Is Shinji-kun in his room?

TV:             I told you, it's impossible.

Asuka:          He's shut himself in for a while now.
                It seems he doesn't wanna see his father.
                If he hates him, he should say he doesn't want to go.
                Japanese people are so...

TV:             I'd been trying to forget you for three years.

Misato:         It is not that he really hates him.

TV:             Don't say such a thing now.

Misato:          That's a problem, alright.
-------------------------------
Ikari:          Go home!

Ikari:          Well done, Shinji.

Misato:         Shinji-kun, I'm coming in.

Misato:         Are you afraid of that? Being alone with your father?
                It's no good to run away all the time.
                You must step forward.
                Otherwise nothing will change.

Shinji:         I know.

Misato:         You are going to find out,
                Not only the first step, but you also have to continue
                to walk after the first one.
                Anyhow, you must go there with your chin up tomorrow,
                since you'll be seeing your mother.

Misato:         Then, g'night.

-----------
Asuka:          Hey, you bought a dress for tomorrow? Let me see!

Misato:         (laugh), you wanna see? It's a very expensive one.

Asuka:          That's your opinion, not the price.

Misato:         Here it is. This is perfect!

Asuka:          Yeah! Did you take Kaji-san's tastes into account?

Misato:         I must not. That was over long ago.

------------------------------------------------
Misato:         Then,

Asuka:          I'm

Shinji:         Off.

------------------------------------------------

Speech:         From now on, you must keep three bags in your mind, and ...

Song:           Red, Blue, and Yellow dr...

# Famous oldies in Japan.
# "Red, Blue, and Yellow dress. With the dress, the ladybirds are
# about to dance! Synchonizing to the Samba's rithm, they dance!"

Toastmaster:    Now, it's the time for some good conversation.

------------------------------------------------

        Mr. Kaji Ryouji

Ritsuko:        He hasn't come yet. Ryou-chan.

Misato:         That idiot never comes on time.

Ritsuko:        That was when he dated.
                His attitude was different on the job.

Ryouji:         Hi! You two are more beautiful than ever today.
                I didn't get out of work on time.

Misato:         You're always idling.

Ryouji:         (Laugh)

Misato:         Anyhow, why don't you shave that sloppy beard?
                And that tie is a mess.

Ryouji:         Sorry.

Ritsuko:        You two look like you're married.

Misato:         Ah!

Ryouji:         Good point! Ritchan.

Misato:         Who would marry this kind of guy?!

-------------------------------------------------------
Ikari:          It's been three years since the last time I was here
                with you alone.

Shinji:         Since that time I ran away, I've never come here.
                I don't feel like my mother sleeps here.
                I don't remember my mother's face.

Ikari:          People continue to live by forgetting things.
                Nevertheless, we have something that we must not forget.
                Yui let me know that indispensable thing.
                To confirm that, I come here.

Shinji:         Don't you have a photo of her or something?

Ikari:          Nothing is left.
                This grave is nothing but a decoration.
                There were no remains.

Shinji:         As my teacher says, you cast everything away.

Ikari:          Everything is in my mind.
                I am satisfied with that, now .

-----------
Ikari:          It's time. I'm leaving.

Shinji:         Father!
                I mean, I am glad, that I had a chance to talk with you today.

Ikari:          Is that so?

NEON
GENESIS
EVANGELION

EPISODE: 15

Those women longed for the touch of other's lips, and thus invited
their kisses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji:         huh?

Asuka:          Not bad!

Asuka:          You know something like that?

Shinji:         I've been learning since I was five.  This skill...
                I'm not particulartly talented.

Asuka:          Sticking with it is power.
                I'll think a little better of you.

Shinji:         I began this following my teacher's advise.
                I could have quited immediately.

Asuka:          So, why have you continued?

Shinji:         No one told me to stop.

Asuka:          That figures.

Shinji:         You came back early. I thought you would have supper.

Asuka:          It wasn't any fun to be with that boy.
                So, I escaped while we were in line
                for the roller coaster.

Shinji:         That's so cold.

Asuka:          Oh! Only Kaji-san is a real man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato:         It's too late to say such a thing.
                I''m going to fix my hair.

Ryouji:         But don't run away.

Misato:         Beeee.

Ryouji:         Pumps...

Ryouji:         It's been a long time since we three had a drink.

Ritsuko:        She drank too much.
                She's playing around.

Ryouji:         To keep oneself from playing, one drinks more.
                Well, today, it's not me but her.

Ritsuko         But the words of the man who lived with her are important.

Ryouji:         We lived together, though it was before Katsuragi wore
                pumps.

Ritsuko:        We never imagined that during our school days.

Ryouji:         I was just a kid, so it wasn't the life of a man and a woman,
                just room-sharing. Yeah, it was children playing.

Ryoji:          Oh, here you are. A souvenir from a cat.

Ritsuko:        Oh, thanks.
                What an honest man you are.

Ryouji:         To the ladies.
                But a slacker in business.

Ritsuko:        I doubt that.
                And with Misato?

Ryouji:         I lost once. It's not my policy to fight
                a war that I'm sure to lose.

Ritsuko:        I think you have a chance to win.

Ryouji:         To win you, Ritchan?

Ritsuko:        It's not my policy to talk about myself.
                There's nothing amusing there.

Ryouji:         She's not yet back. Katsuragi might be fixing her makeup?

Ritsuko:        What were you doing in Kyoto?

Ryouji:         That souvenir is from Matsushiro.

Ritsuko:        It's no use pretending.
                Too much investigation, and you'll get burned.
                This is advise from a friend.

Ryouji:         I'll take you seriously.
                But, if I get burned, I wish it would be by the fire of love wit
h you...

Misato:         Shall I buy some fireworks for you?

Ryouji:         Oh, you're back.

Misato:         Your attitude never changes.

Ryouji:         Oh, yes, I am changing. To live is to change.

Ritsuko:        Homeostasis and transistasis.

Misato:         What are those?

Ritsuko:        The power to conserve the present status, and the power
                to change.
                The thing which has those two contradictory properties is life.

Ryouji:         That is, men and women.

Ritsuko:        I'm leaving now.
                I still have work to do.

Misato:         You're really leaving?

Ritsuko:        Yeah.

Ryouji:         I am very sorry.

Ritsuko:        See you later.

Misato:         later.

-----------------------
Phone(Misato):  Is that you Shinchan? It's me.
                I'm drinking with Kaji-kun.
                Yeah, it's our third party.

# If you drink later with somebody who was at a party,
# the drinking is called the "Second party."
# And if you drink after the second party,
# it's the Third party.

Shinji:         hm, hm, alright. bye.

Asuka:          Misato?

Shinji:         Yeah. She said she'll be back very late.
                She said "go to bed before I get back"

Asuka:          Oh! Is she coming back tomorrow morning?

Shinji:         I don't think so, because she's with Kaji-san.

Asuka:          You idiot!  Because of that.

--------------------------------------------
Misato:         wwww.

Ryouji:         You're old enough. You shouldn't throw up.

Misato:         Sorry that I'm old enough.

Ryouji:         I'm old enough as well.

Misato:         That's right.

Ryouji:         You are wearing pumps. I feel that it's been a long time.

Misato:         You'd better shave that sloppy beard.

Ryouji:         alright

Misato:         OK, I'll walk from here. Thanks.

Ryouji:         hm.

Misato:         Kaji-kun, have I changed?

Ryouji:         You've gotten prettier.

Misato:         I am sorry that I insisted on separating back then.
                I told you that I had another love,
                but that was a lie.
                Did you find out?

Ryouji:         No.

Misato:         I found, I found that you had something that resembled my
                father.
                I was looking for someone like my father. When I discovered
                that, I was afraid. I was afraid of  everything.
                I was afraid of being with you.
                I was afraid of being a woman. I was afraid of everything.
                Although I had hated my father,
                I happened to love a man who looked like my father.

Misato:         To forget everything, I joined NERV, which, however, was the
                institute where my father had been.
                I've been pretending to take revenge on the Angels.
                Phew.

Ryouji:         It's you who chose that path.
                You don't have to apologize to me.

Misato:         No! I didn't choose that path. I just tried to run away.
                I just tried to escape from my father's spell.
                Just like Shinji-kun.
                I'm a coward.
                I am sorry.
                Tonight, I'm talking like this because I'm drunk.

Ryouji:         That's enough.

Ryouji:         I am a child. I have no right to say anything to Shinji-kun.

Ryouji:         That's enough.

Misato:         And then, I try to depend on a man only in situations
                like this. I am a horrible woman.
                Back then, I might have used you.
                I hate myself!

Ryouji:         That's enough! Stop it!

Misato:         I don't know what I can do!
                uuh...

Asuka:          Hey, Shinji, let's kiss.

Shinji:         E? what?

Asuka:          I said kiss. Kiss. You've never kissed, right?

Shinji:         No.

Asuka:          Then, let's kiss.

Shinji:         Hm.. How come?

Asuka:          Because I don't have anything to do.

Shinji:         Nothing to do, so, kiss? That's ...

Asuka:          You don't want to kiss a girl on the anniversary of
                your mother's death?
                Are you afraid that your mother might be watching us
                from heaven?

Shinji:         Not really.

Asuka:          Or, are you afraid?

Shinji:         I am not. I'll kiss you.

Asuka:          Have you brushed your teeth?

Shinji:         yeah.

Asuka:          Then, here we go.

Asuka:          The breath from your nose is tickling me. Don't breathe.

Shinji:         Guwaa.

PenPen:         kwawaa wa wa hya.

Shinji:         gwaaa

Asuka:          (gargling)
                Phew! I can't believe I did that just to kill time.
                (gargling)

----------
Ryouji:         Hey, here we are. Pull yourself together.

Shinji:         Kaji-san!

Asuka:          Oh! Kaji-san?

-------------------
Misato:         Phew, that's hard.

Ryouji:         OK, I'll leave now.

Asuka:          How about staying here tonight?

Ryouji:         People will laugh at me if I go office in this suit.

Asuka:          That doesn't matter. It's OK!
                Hey! Kaji-san!

Asuka:          He smells of lavender.

-------------
Ryouji:         Sorry. Please take care of Katsuragi.

Shinji:         Alright.

Ryouji:         OK, g'night.

Shinji:         Good night.

Shinji:         What's the matter? You seem depressed.

Asuka:          Because I kissed a guy like you!

Ryouji:         Hi!  How is your hangover?

Misato:         Thanks to this, I'm completely clear.

Ryouji:         That's nice.

Misato:         Is this your real job?
                Or just a part-time job?

Ryouji:         I wonder...

Misato:         The person belonging to the Special Investigations Section,
                of Special Institute Nerv:  Kaji Ryouji.
                At the same time, the person belonging to
                the inquiry section of Japan's Ministry of the Interior,
                Kaji Ryouji.

Ryouji:         Oh, you've found out about that.

Misato:         Don't underestimate Nerv!

Ryouji:         Was this ordered by Commander Ikari?

Misato:         On my own accord. If you pursue this part-time job further,
                you shall die.

Ryouji:         Commander Ikari makes use of me, so I can go further.
                Anyhow, I'm sorry that I've kept this a secret from you.

Misato:         Since I appreciate what you did yesterday,
                I'll let it pass.

Ryouji:         Thanks.
                However, the Commander and Ritchan have also
                kept something secret from you.
                This!

Misato:         This is...
                Eva?...
                No,..
                Is this...

Ryouji:         Yes. The key to Second Impact and everything since,
                the starting point of everything. This is Adam.

Misato:         Adam?
                The first Angel is here?
                It looks like I've been underestimating Nerv.
