EVANGELION Episode 13

* Computer Room like place
* Ritsuko, Keyboarding sound

Female Operator: Apotheosis Operation of the three EVA units will be done as 
        scheduled when the MAGI system resumes its operation.

Male Operator: Operation confirmed.  Abbreviate 450 to 670.

Makoto(Glasses): Command center has consented.

Ritsuko: You're quick.  Then again, you are Maya.

Maya:   Of course.  You were the one who directly taught me.

Ritsuko: Oh, wait.  A8 would be faster there.  Let me see.

Maya:   After all, she taught me.

* Misato coming up in an elevator

Misato: How's it going? Is MAGI's check-up finished?

Ritsuko: Almost done. As promised, I completed it by today's test.

Misato: You're great, Ritsuko.  You have three of those same hard-to-take-
        care-of things, and still make it on time.

Ritsuko: That one is cold.

Misato: Ugha!

-------------------------------
* Control Center.  MAGI on the screen.

Male Operator: All three MAGI systems are now in self-diagnostics mode.

Maya:   127th periodic check-up, all clear.

Ritsuko: Understood.  Well done, and take a break until the test.

------------------------------
* Ladies' Room.  Ritsuko washing her face.

Ritsuko: All clear...  Today, as ever, my mother is just fine, but... 
         am I only aging?

------------------------------

------------------------------

* An elevator ascends the huge vertical hole

Asuka:  What?  Strip again?

Ritsuko: From here on in lies the ultra-clean room.  Just showering and
        changing your undies are not enough.

Asuka:  Why do I gotta go thorough all these things just for the 
        auto-piloting test?

Ritsuko: Not only does time progress, but the technology of EVA as well.  
        We always need new data.

Asuka:  What?

------------------
* Door Opens.  All three pilots are naked.

Asuka:  There, I'm just as you wanted--washed and cleansed seventeen times.

Ritsuko: Now, all three of you, staying as you are now, go through this 
        room and board the entry plug.

Asuka:  WHAT?!

Ritsuko: Don't worry--the video monitors are turned off.  Your privacy 
        is protected.

Asuka:  That ain't the point. It's about how I feel.

Ritsuko: The point of this test is to read the harmonics directly from the 
        body, without the assistance of the plug suit.

Misato: Asuka, this is an order.

Asuka:  Fine! Just do NOT watch, okay?

---------------------------------------

Male Operator: All pilots prepared for entry.

Ritsuko: Begin the test.

* EVA's simulation bodies are floating in the water.

Male Operator: Start testing.  Start memorizing auto-piloting.

Male Operator: Inserting simulation plug.

Female Operator: Connecting systems with simulation bodies.

Female Operator: Simulation plug is now under control of MAGI.

Misato: It's so fast. MAGI... Oh, great MAGI.  I simply can't believe it took
        a week for the first test.

Male Operator: According to the schedule, this test should end in three hours. 

Ritsuko: How are you feeling?

Rei:    Something is different.

Shinji: Yes.  Something is different from the other times.

Asuka:  Something's wrong with my senses.  Only the right arm is clear, and
        the rest is dim.

Ritsuko: Rei, imagine movement in the right arm.

Rei:    Yes.

Male Operator: Data collection going well.

Ritsuko: There does not appear to be any problems.  Return MAGI to normal.

Misato: Dilemma...

Ritsuko: The personality of their creator can be guessed.

Misato: What are you talking about? Didn't you make them?

Ritsuko: You do not know anything, do you?

Misato: That's because, unlike me, you're not exactly talkative about 
        yourself.

Ritsuko: Well, I just did the system-up.  My mother designed the basic 
        theory as well as the body.

---------------------------------------

Fuyutsuki: Have you double checked this?

Shigeru: Yes, sir. They're the parts which were brought in three days ago.

Long Hair: They must be the parts where changes were found.

Fuyutsuki: The 87th protein wall...

Long Hair: When enlarged, some spots can be seen.  What are they?

Glasses: Must be corrosion.  There are small changes in the temperature and
        conductivity. Deterioration of a sterilized room often happens,
        and more often as of late.

Long Hair: The construction schedule was shortened by 60 days or so, so the
        air bubbles must have gotten in then.  There are a lot of holes in 
        the quality of the construction work in B Wing.

Fuyutsuki: That part was done after the Angels appeared, right?

Glasses: We can't really blame them. Everyone is tired.

Fuyutsuki: Take care of it by tomorrow. Ikari will be exasperated by it 
        otherwise.

------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko: Is the water leaking again?

Maya:   No, sir. It's the corrosion in the walls above here.

Ritsuko: Great. Will it pose any trouble on the test?

Maya:   So far, no, it will not.

Ritsuko: Then continue.  This test cannot be easily aborted.  Commander Ikari
        will be annoyed with us, as well.

Maya:   Understood.  Synchronized position is normal.

Male Operator: Connecting the entry plug to EVA units through the simulation
        bodies.

Male Operator: Contact confirmed.

Female Operator: AT-Fields are generated on 3 Jogt.
------------------------------------------

* The spots on the wall start growing.  Emergency sirens go off.

Ritsuko: What happened?

Female Operator: Contamination alert in the Sigma Unit, A Floor.

Male Operator: 87th wall is deteriorating, releasing heat.

Male Operator: Abnormality found in the 6th pipe, also.

Maya:   Corrosion of the protein wall is spreading.  The speed is 
        explosive.

Ritsuko: Abort the test.  Shut down the 6th pipe.

Maya:   Understood.

Male Operator: 60, 38, 39, all were shut down.

Male Operator: Corrosion found on 6-42.

Maya:   No effect. The corrosion is spreading along the walls.

Ritsuko: Prepare polysomes...

Ritsuko: Laser at the maximum.  Fire at the invasion.

Maya:   The corrosion has reached 6-58. It's coming!

* (Angel's voice)

Rei:    No!

Ritsuko: Rei!

Maya:   Rei's simulation body is moving!

Ritsuko: Impossible.

Maya:   Corrosion still spreading.  It's invading the active water system of
        the simulation bodies.

Misato: How's Rei?

Maya:   She's all right.

Ritsuko: Eject all plugs now.  Hurry the laser.

Misato: AT-Field!

Ritsuko: No way.

Misato: What's... this?

Ritsuko: Analysis of pattern: blue.  It's an Angel, no question.

Fuyutsuki: An Angel? You let an Angel get inside?

Ritsuko: Sorry, sir.

Fuyutsuki: No excuse needed.  Close the Central Dogma.  Separate it from 
        Sigma Unit.

Male Operator: Central Dogma, closed down physically.  Separating it from 
        Sigma Unit.

Misato: Abandon this Box.  Evacuate.

* Operators running.

Misato: What are you doing?  Hurry!

* Misato pulls Ritsuko along with her.

Female Operator: Separating Sigma Unit from B Floor.  All partitions closing.
        Everyone within the area is to evacuate.

Gendou: I know. Please take care of it.

* Gendou hangs up the phone

Gendou: Stop the alert.

Long Hair: S-- stopping the alert, sir.

Gendou: It was a mistake. An error in the detector.  Tell the Japanese 
        government and the Committee so.

Long Hair: Y-- yes, sir.

Glasses: The contaminated area is still descending.

Fuyutsuki: It is on the critical place.

Gendou: Yes. It is too close to ADAM.

Gendou: Contain the corrosion around the Sigma unit. You may sacrifice the 
        Geo-Front.  Status of EVA?

Glasses: Waiting at the 7th cage.  They can go as soon as the pilots are 
         retrieved.

Gendou: No need to wait for the pilots.  Just launch them to the surface 
        as soon as the preparations are complete. 

Long Hair & Glasses: What?!

Gendou: Unit-01 has priority.  You may abandon the rest.

Glasses: Unit-01, sir? 

Long Hair: But sir, without EVA we cannot physically destroy the Angel.

Gendou: If EVA gets contaminated, we are completely finished.  Hurry!

Long Hair & Glasses:  Y-- yes, sir.

Female Operator: Central Dogma under Sigma Unit will be completely 
        sealed off in 60 seconds. 30 seconds until the activation of 
        the vacuum pump.

-----------------------------------------------
Ryouji: So, that is the Angel. Can't do the work anymore. Ha.

----------------------------------------------
Female Operator: Central Dogma totally sealed.  Mega-depth facilities
        are now wholly occupied by the invader.

Fuyutsuki: Now, how will we mount an offensive against the Angels 
        without EVA?

EPISODE:13

LILLIPUTIAN HITCHER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko: Look. Here is the boundary of the heavy water, where more oxygen 
        exists.

Maya:   Its preference is pretty clear.

Long Hair: The place where ozone is vented in to maintain the sterilized 
        conditions is not contaminated.

Misato: So, does that mean its weakness is oxygen?

Ritsuko: It seems so.

Glasses: Injecting ozone.  Concentration increasing.

Long Hair: It's working, all right.

Fuyutsuki: Can we make it?

Maya:   0A and 0B seem to be recovering.

Long Hair: The area near the pipe is back to the normal.

Glasses: As expected, the central parts are more difficult.

Fuyutsuki: Okay, increase the ozone.

Ritsuko: Something is wrong.

Long Hair: What? It's increasing.

Glasses: Something is wrong.  Heat release is increasing.

Long Hair: Contaminated area is again increasing.

Maya:   All effects of the ozone have been lost.

Glasses: Now it's absorbing the ozone.

Ritsuko: Stop the ozone flow.

Ritsuko: Incredible. It is evolving.

Misato: What's wrong?

Long Hair: The Sub-computer is being hacked.  Hacker is unidentified.

Glasses: Not now. Dealing with C mode.

Long Hair: Unfreezing the barrier.  Decoy entry opened.

Male Operator: Decoy entry avoided.

Male Operator: 18 seconds 'til trace completed.

Male Operator: Opening the barrier.

Male Operator: Barrier broken.

Male Operator: Accessing another decoy entry.

Glasses: A human being could not do this.

Male Operator: Trace successful.  Hacker is within this facility.

Long Hair: Under the B-Wing.  It's Pribnow Box!

Maya:   The optical pattern is changing.

Long Hair: The growing lines are the electrical circuits. It's a computer
        itself...

Glasses: Opening decoy entry...  Unsuccessful. There was interference.

Misato: Sever the Main Cable.

Male Operator: Negative. It refuses to accept the order.

Misato: Fire the laser.

Maya:   AT-Field generated.  No effect.

Long Hair: It's accessing to the Security Mainbank.  It's cracking
        the password. 12th digit, 16th digit. D word cleared.

Fuyutsuki: God!

Glasses: It's reading the Mainbank.  Impossible to clear.

Fuyutsuki: What does it want?

Long Hair: It's searching the Mainbank. This code is... No! It wants to 
        invade MAGI!

Gendou: Shut down the I/O system.

Long Hair: Count down, please.

Glasses: 3, 2, 1...

Glasses and Long Hair: Argh!

Glasses: It can't be turned off!

Maya:   Angel is invading further.  Contacting Melchior.
        It's about to take control...
        Melchior has been reprogrammed by the Angel.

Voice:  Self-destruction suggested by AI Melchior.  Rejection, rejection, 
        rejection.

Long Hair: Now Melchior is hacking Balthazar.

Glasses: Damn! It's so fast!

Long Hair: What calculation speed!

Ritsuko: (taking a breath) Change the login mode.  Tune synchro-code to every
        fifteen minutes.

Glasses and Long Hair: Roger.

Fuyutsuki: How long do we have?

Long Hair: Judging from observations, about 2 hours.

Gendou: MAGI... against us.

---------------------------------------

* Command Center.  No one is there.  The visual of Angel is on

Ritsuko: They are nano-machines, Angels the size of virii. Each of them 
        gather to form a colony, and in a short time, they exponentially 
        evolve, sufficient to form an intelligence circuit.

Fuyutsuki: Evolution...

Ritsuko: Yes, sir.  They constantly evolve themselves, seeking the best way
        to cope with situations.

Fuyutsuki: It is the system for survival of the life form itself.

Misato: The only effective means of fighting a subject which constantly 
        evolves and overcoming its weakness is take it with us.  The only 
        option is to order MAGI to commit suicide and have it die with 
        MAGI.  I suggest the physical elimination of MAGI.

Ritsuko: Impossible. Aborting MAGI means abandoning Headquarters.

Misato: Then, for the strategy section, I formally request it.

Ritsuko: I reject it. This is a matter for the engineering section.

Misato: Why are you acting like a mule?!

Ritsuko: This situation started because of my mistake.

Misato: You've always been like that, keeping everything to yourself and never
        depending on the others.

Ritsuko: As long as the Angels keep evolving, we still have a chance.

Gendou: Promotion of the evolution?

Ritsuko: Yes, sir.

Gendou: The end of the evolution is self-destruction.  It is death itself.

Fuyutsuki: Then, what we should do is promote evolution.

Ritsuko: If the Angels consider it their only effective means of the 
        survival, they may choose the co-existence with MAGI.

Glasses: But how?

Ritsuko: If the target is the computer itself, we can reverse hack by directly
        connecting Casper and the Angels and, by doing so, a self-destruct 
        promotion code can be uploaded.  However...

Maya:   At the same time, we are opening the barrier to the Angels.

Gendou: "Is Casper or the ANGELS faster?", right?

Misato: You can make the program it on time, right? If Casper is taken over
        completely, we're done for.

Ritsuko: I keep my promises.

* MAGI on the screen

Female Operator: Red Alert, Red Alert. There is an emergency within NERV 
        HQ.  All emergency workers are to be evacuated.

Maya: (looking inside Casper) W-- What are those?

Ritsuko: Notes by the system developer.

Maya:   Cripes! Those are the secret codes of MAGI!

Misato: It's just like the map to MAGI's back door.

Maya:   Owwww, am I allowed to see such a things?  Can't believe it!  This is
        c of int!  With these, we can program much faster than was expected.

Ritsuko: Thanks, Mother. We can make it for certain.

Ritsuko: Get me that wrench.

Misato: Reminds me of when we were in college.

Ritsuko: Board number 25.

Misato: Mmmmm... Will you tell me about MAGI?  Just a little?

Ritsuko: It's a long story.  But not much fan.  Do you know of the personality
        transfer OS?

Misato: Yes. It is a system to transfer a person's personality, making a 
       7th generation organic computer able to think by itself.  It's used
       to operate EVA, too.

Ritsuko: I heard the MAGI were the first one to use it.  My mother 
        developed it.

Misato: Your mother's personality was transferred to MAGI?

Ritusko: Yes.

Ritsuko: In other word, these brains are my mother's.

Misato: Is that why you wanted to protect MAGI?

Ritsuko: I do not think so. I never liked my mother much.  It was a 
        decision as a scientist.

Glasses: Balthazar has now been taken over.

Voice:  Self-destruction is now voted for by the AIs.  Self-destruction 
        will be executed 20 seconds after all three have agreed to it.  
        The ranges of self- destruction are Geoid depth -280, -140, and 
        floor 0. Due to the activation of special rule 582, cancellation 
        by two of the AIs is impossible.

Misato: It has begun?

Long Hair: Balthazar is further invading Casper.

Fuyutsuki: They're pushing us.

Glasses: What speed!!

Voice:  Self-destruction in 20 seconds.

Fuyutsuki: Oh, no.

Long Hair: Casper will be taken over in 18 seconds.

Voice:  Self-destruction in 15 seconds.

Misato: Ritsuko! Hurry!

Voice:  Self-destruction in 10 seconds.

Ritsuko: Don't worry. We're one second ahead.

Voice:  Self-destruction in 9 seconds.

Misato: A SECOND?

VOICE:  8--

Ritsuko: Not zero, not negative. Maya.

Voice:  7, 6--

Maya:   We can do it.

Voice:  5, 4, 3--

Ritsuko: Hit it.

Voice:  2, 1, 0.

Voice:  Self-destruction cancelled by AIs.

Glasses: Haha!

Long Hair: YES!

Maya and Misato: (Smiling Sighs)

Voice:  Special rule 582 has been cleared.  MAGI system return to normal.

Ritsuko: Pfew!

Voice:  Red Alert cleared.  Red Alert cleared.  Everyone back to type one 
        alert.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* In Entry plug, floating on a pond

Shinji: What is going on?

Asuka:  Yeee! I can't get out of here without any clothing!  Someone, help 
        me FAST!

Maya:   Sigma Unit now released. -03 until the reopening the of MAGI system.

Ritsuko: Am I already too old for an all-nighter?

Misato: (handing a cup to Ritusko) Once again, you kept your promise.  
        Good job.

Ritsuko: Thank you.  This is the first time I've thought that coffee you 
        made is delicious.

Misato: Hehehe.

Ritusko: A night before her death, my mother told me the MAGI are three of 
        herself--as a scientist, as a mother, and as a woman.  The MAGI 
        are those three fighting each other.  She purposely left the 
        dilemma of human beings within it.  To be honest, each program 
        is slightly different from the others. Since I do not seem to be 
        a mother, I cannot understand my mother as a mother.  But as a 
        scientist, I respected her.  And as a woman, I even hated her.  

Misato: You're talkative today.

Ritsuko: In Casper, her pattern as a woman was input. She stayed 
        a woman to the last.  It was just like my mother.
