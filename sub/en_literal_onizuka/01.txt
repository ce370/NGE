OPENING THEME SONG

This is in A.D. 2015.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


*A strange, gigantic creature cruises underwater in a submerged city

*A group of tanks with their cannon aimed at the city

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Radio:  Today at 12:30, a state of special emergency has been declared
        within Kanto and Chubu districts, around Tokai district. Please
        take refuge in the designated shelters. Repeat... Today--

     #Tokai is the district between Tokyo and Nagoya. Kanto and Chubu
     #contains Tokai and the large area north of it.

 *All destination panels at the station show 'All lines are out of
  service'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *In a car, with someone driving

Misato: Why, of all times, have I missed him now?!
        What am I going to do?

        #The Japanese below the photo of Shinji is his name 'Ikari 
        #Shinji', written in katakana. He wears a uniform, which 
        #most junior high school students must wear in Japan. His 
        #clothing in this episode seems a kind of them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *A boy is calling from a telephone booth

Phone:  All normal lines are out of order due to the state of special
        emergency.

Shinji: Out of order... I shouldn't have come...

     #The Traffic panel shows "Tokyo-3: 13km, Gotenba: 35km." Gotenba
     #is located at the foot of Mt. Fuji.

     #You can see some handwriting on the photo. It says: "Dear
     #Shinji-kun. I'm coming to meet you, so please wait for me."
     #Attention to here! (her breasts)

Shinji: I may not be able to meet her. Can't be helped--I'll head to the 
        shelter.

 *A sudden strong wind

Shinji: Uh...

Shinji: Ahh...

 *A gigantic creature walking

Shinji: Ahhh!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Operational Display

     #I wonder if the place where I think UN Force Headquarters in
     #Tokyo-3 is the same place which I regard Nerv Headquarters.

     #I'll check it, but unfortunately I don't yet have enough information
     #to confirm it.

Female Voice: The identified moving object is still approaching
              our position.

Male Voice: We have a visual image of the target. Transferring it to the 
        main screen.

 *Two men (Gendo and Fuyutsuki)

Fuyutsuki: It's been 15 years...

Gendo:  Yes, certainly.

Fuyutsuki: Angels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TITLE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EPISODE: 1

ANGEL ATTACK

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * UN forces attack the Angel

Aircraft: All missiles hit the target!

Aircraft: Ahh!

 * A UN aircraft crashed

Shinji: Ahh!

 *Misato stops the car and opens the door

Misato: Sorry to have kept you waiting...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Male Voice: Target is still intact. It's continuing toward Tokyo-3.

Female Voice: It cannot be stopped by Air Force firepower.

 *Missile attacks

 *3 commanders of the UN force

Sub Commander A: Total war! Commit all divisions at Atsugi and
   Iruma Bases to the battle!

     #Atsugi is the US base in Japan. Iruma is the Japanese Air Defense
     #Force's base.

Sub Commander B: Hold nothing back! Destroy the target at any cost!

 *Another missile attack, but no effect.

Sub Commander A: Why?! That must have been a direct hit!

Sub Commander B: The tank battalion has been wiped out. Guided
        missiles and cannon shells have no effect on it...

Sub Commander A: It's useless!  With such limited firepower, we can do 
        nothing!

 *Gendo & Fuyutsuki

Fuyutsuki: So it's protected by an AT-Field, as we thought?

Gendo:  Yes. Normal weapons have no effect on Angels.

 *A phone call

One of Cmdr: Understood, sir. I'll deploy it as previously arranged.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *The Angel is in the distance

 *Misato looks through field glasses

Misato: Wait, it can't be... They're gonna use an N2 bomb?! Get down!

 *A big explosion

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Sub Cmdr A: All right!

Sub Cmdr B: Sorry that we've left nothing for you to do.

Female Voice: Shock wave inbound!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Misato and Shinji near the overturned car

Misato: Are you all right?

Shinji: Yeah, but there's something crunchy in my mouth.

Misato: That's fine. Well... you ready?

Misato: Here goes!

 *They succeed in turning over the car.

Misato: Thanks a lot. Good job.

Shinji: You, too, Katsuragi-san...

Misato: Call me Misato. Please to meet you, Ikari Shinji-kun.

Shinji: Me, too.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cmdr-in-Chief: Condition of target?

Female Voice: Undetermined due to radio wave interference.

Sub Cmdr A: It was such a massive explosion, it must have been destroyed.

Male Voice: Sensors again operational.

Female Voice: An energy reaction at the center of the explosion!

Sub Cmdr A: What the hell?!

Male Voice: Visual image restored.

Commanders: Oh...!

Sub Commander B: That was our trump card... 

Cmdr-in-Chief: Unbelievable...

Sub Cmdr A: It's a monster!

 *Angel regenerating itself

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Misato drives her broken car while making a phone call

Misato: Sure. Don't worry. His protection is my highest priority. 
        Prepare a train car for us--a linear one, please. Right. It 
        was my idea to meet him, so I'll take full responsibility 
        for him. 'Bye.

Misato (thinking): This is terrible! I just finished restoring my 
        car... It's a wreck now...

Misato (thinking): 33 loan payments left... And the repair costs...!

Misato (thinking): Even worse, my only good clothes have been ruined...

Shinji: Misato-san...

Misato (thinking): And I was in such a good mood! Damn...

Shinji: Excuse me, Misato-san...?

Misato: Eh, what?

Shinji: You sure it was all right to do that?

 *Batteries which she seems to have stolen...

Misato: Ah, it's fine, it's fine. It was during an emergency... We
        can't do anything if the car doesn't run. 
        Anyway, I AM an international officer, even if I don't seem 
        like it.

Shinji: That doesn't seem like a very good excuse.

Misato: Boring kid. Your expression's blank, so unsuited to your 
        pretty face.

Shinji: You think so...?

Misato: Hmm, are you angry? Sorry, I'm sorry. It'd only be natural because
        you're a boy.

Shinji: You're childish for your age, aren't you?

 *Misato drives the car roughly

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Injured Angel stands in the plain

Fuyutsuki: It's regenerating itself, as expected.

Gendo:  If it didn't, it would be useless as an independent weapon.

Cmdr:   Ohhh...

Fuyutsuki: Oh, I'm impressed. It can also amplify its own functions.

Gendo:  In addition, it has gained intelligence.

Fuyutsuki: The next invasion is only a matter of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *A car-transport train departing from the station

Announce: The gate is closing. Attention, please. The train is about
        to depart. This train ...

Shinji: The special agency Nerv?

Misato: Yes, a secret organization directly attached to the United 
        Nations.

Shinji: It's the one my father belongs to.

Misato: Yeah, well. Do you know what he does?

Shinji: It's an important job protecting the human race, or so my teacher 
        said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Gendo standing before the 3 commanders of the UN force in Nerv 
 Headquarters

Cmdr-in-Chief: You have command of this operation from this point 
        on. We'll observe how you handle the situation.

Gendo:  Yes, sir.

Sub Cmdr B: Ikari-kun, considering our available weaponry, I must admit
        that we have no effective defense against the target.

Cmdr-in-Chief: And you are confident of defeating it?

Gendo:  It's for that reason Nerv exists.

Cmdr-in-Chief: We expect much from you.

     #UN Commanders disappear.

Female Voice: No change in target.

Male Voice: Present effective rate of interception is 7.5 %.

Fuyutsuki: The U.N. Troops can't help us. What are you going to do?

Gendo:  I'll activate Evangelion Unit-01.

Fuyutsuki: Unit-01? But we have no pilot.

Gendo:  No problem--another is being delivered.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Shinji and Misato in her car on the car train

Shinji: Are we going to meet my father?

Misato: Well, yes, we are.

Shinji: Father...

Misato: Ah, right, did your father give you an ID?

Shinji: Oh, yeah.

Shinji: Here.

Misato: Thanks!

     #Japanese on the top of the paper is 'Ikari Shinji'. The one at
     #the bottom is 'Come! Ikari Gendo'.

Misato: Then, read this.

     #'Top Secret' is on Misato's side. 'Welcome to Nerv' is on
     #Shinji's side.

Shinji: It's about my father's work... Is there something for me to do?

Shinji: I'm not surprised. He won't write to me... unless he wants me for 
        something.

Misato: I know. You find him cold...  
        So do I.

 *Underground city appears

Shinji: Incredible! A real Geo-front!

     # 'Geo-front' is English word which was made in Japan. It means
     #underground space which the people can use for living, 
     #manufacturing, etc. Because Japan is small, the development plan
     #of underground space is studied.

Misato: That's right. This is our secret base, Nerv Headquarters.
        It's also the foundation for the rebuilding of the world 
        and a fortress for the human race.

NEON GENESIS EVANGELION EPISODE:1 ANGEL ATTACK

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji and Misato on a moving walkway

Misato: That's strange. I was sure this is the right way ...

     #Japanese on the top means 'Nerv Headquarters'. The handwriting
     #on the map means 'HERE!' The handwritten 'WC' beside the
     #map means 'lavatory/rest room'.

     #Japanese on the top means 'Nerv Headquarters'. The handwriting
     #on the map means 'HERE!'

Misato: I'd really rather not wear a skirt in here. 
        At any rate, where's Ritsuko? Sorry that I'm not familiar with 
        this place.

Shinji: We've been by here before.

Misato: But don't worry--systems exist to be used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Announce: Chief of Project E at Section 1 of the Technical Department,
        Dr. Akagi Ritsuko, Dr. Akagi Ritsuko. Please contact Captain
        Katsuragi Misato at Section 1 of the Operations Department 
        immediately.

     #Misato's rank is 'Ichi-i' in Japanese.

     #Japanese on the cylinder seems to mean 'Air'.

 *Ritsuko takes her wetsuit off.

Ritsuko: I'm amazed. She must have gotten lost again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 * Ritsuko enters the elevator which Shinji and Misato took

Misato: Ah! H-- hi, Ritsuko...

Ritsuko: What were you doing, Captain Katsuragi? We are short on both hands 
        and time!

Misato: Sorry...

Ritsuko: He's the boy.

Misato: Yes, according to Malduck's report, he's the "Third Children".

 * Apparently Gainax has a reason for using "Children" instead of "Child".

Ritsuko: Nice to meet you.

Shinji: Ah... yes.

Misato: He's rather like his father... neither are very sociable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Gendo descending by lift

Gendo:  Well, I trust you.

Fuyutsuki: They're meeting for the first time in three years.

Male Voice: Sub-Commander, the target is moving again.

Fuyutsuki: Well... Red alert! All hands to battle stations!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Shinji, Misato and Ritsuko coming up on the lift with a pink/red
  background

Female Voice: Repeat, red alert! All hands to battle stations!
        Prepare for ground interception of the enemy.

Misato: You hear that?

Ritsuko: This is serious.

Misato: So, how is Unit-00?

Ritsuko: It's outfitted with B-type equipment. It's being frozen.

Misato: Will it really work? I'd heard you hadn't managed that yet.

Ritsuko: The probability of it working is 0.000000001 percent. "09 system"
        seemed like a good name for it.

Misato: You mean it won't work, don't you?

Ritsuko: Don't be rude! The chance isn't zero.

Misato: It's still only a number. Anyway, saying "It doesn't work at 
        all..." won't be much of an excuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *A boat going on the pink water

 *Only a line of light coming through the entrance

 *A sudden blackout

Shinji: Ah, it's pitch dark.

 *The big (ugly!) face of Evangelion appears before Shinji as lights snap on

Shinji: Ah, a face... A giant robot...

Ritsuko: You won't find this in the manual.

Shinji: Eh?

Ritsuko: This is the Multi-purpose Humanoid Fighting Machine EVANGELION, 
        which humanity has finally developed.

Shinji: This is Father's work?

Gendo:  That's right.

 *Gendo appears at the top of the room

Gendo:  It's been a long time.

Shinji: Father...

Gendo:  Move out.

Misato: Move out?! Unit-00 is being frozen... You aren't kidding. You
        mean that you'll activate Unit-01?

Ritsuko: We have no other choice.

Misato: Wait a sec! We can't let Rei board it. We have no pilots.

Ritsuko: One has just been delivered.

Misato: Are you serious?

Ritsuko: Ikari Shinji-kun, you will get into it.

Misato: But even in Ayanami Rei's case, it took a full seven months for 
        her to synchronize with Eva.

Ritsuko: You can only sit in it and try. We would never expect more from you.

Misato: But...

Ritsuko: At present, stopping the Angel's attack has top priority.
         Even if there is little potential for synchronizing with 
         Eva, we have no choice but to have someone board it. Understand, 
         Captain Katsuragi?

Misato: You may be right...

Shinji: Father, why did you call me?

Gendo:  For exactly the reasons you think.

Shinji: Then, you mean I should get into it and fight that thing I saw.

Gendo:  Correct.

Shinji: No way! What are you talking about?! I've always thought you 
        didn't want me!

Gendo:  I called you now because I need you now.

Shinji: Why me...?

Gendo:  Because no one else can.

Shinji: I can't do this. I've neither seen nor heard of this before. 
        Why do you say I can?

Gendo:  Listen to the explanations.

Shinji: No... I can't... It's impossible!

Gendo: If you're going to do this, don't waste time. Otherwise, leave!

 *Many maintenance men anxiously stare at the scenery...

 *Angel attacks the ground above the Nerv Headquarters

Gendo:  That thing seems to have found us.

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun, we have no time.

Misato: Board it.

Shinji: No way. After coming all that way, it's ridiculous.

Misato: Shinji-kun... Why did you come here? Don't run away, not from
   your father and, above all, not from yourself.

Shinji: I understand. But, I don't think I can do this!

Gendo:  Fuyutsuki.

 *Fuyutsuki on the screen

Gendo: Rei--wake her.

Fuyutsuki: Is she available?

Gendo:  She's not dead at least.

Fuyutsuki: Understood.

Gendo:  Rei?

Rei:    Yes.

Gendo:  The replacement turned out to be useless.

Gendo:  Again.

Rei:    Yes.

Ritsuko: Reconfigure the system of Unit-01 for Rei! Restart!

Female Voice: Roger. Aborting current process and restarting.

Shinji: I'm unnecessary, just as I thought...

 *Rei, on a hospital bed, is wheeled in.

 * Angel attacks again

Shinji: Watch out!

 *Eva protects Shinji with its right hand

Shinji: Ah!

Male Voice: Eva moved! What's wrong with it?!

Male Voice: It tore off the binding attached to its right arm.

Ritsuko: That's impossible! The entry plug has not yet been inserted.
        It can't move!

Misato: It reacted without the interface... Or rather, did it protect
        him...? He can do it!

 *Shinji runs to Rei and holds her

 *Rei is suffering in agony

Shinji: Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run
        away, don't run away... 
        I'll do it... I'll get into it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Staff:  Freezing process has finished.

Staff:  The binding on the right arm has been repaired.

Staff:  Position is correct for docking in the cage.

Maya:   The termination signal plug has been discharged.

Staff:  Roger. Insert entry plug.

Operator: The plug has been secured.

Operator: Begin the first connection.

 *Shinji in the entry plug (a cockpit)

Ritsuko: Commence entry plug LCL injection.

Shinji: Huh? What is this? Ah, ah, ah, uguh....

Ritsuko: It's all right. After your lungs fill with LCL, it will directly 
        supply you with oxygen. You'll get used to it soon.

Shinji: Fuah, guhah... I feel sick...

Misato: Bear it! You're a man, aren't you?!

Staff:  Connect to the main power supply.

Staff:  Transmit power to all circuits.

Staff:  Roger.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator: Commencing second contact.

Operator: The connection to the A10-nerve is operational.

Ritsuko: Japanese has been fixed to the system as the fundamental
        method for the control of Eva. 
        All initial contacts are set.

Maya:   Connect the mutual lines. Synchronization rate is 41.3%.

Ritsuko: Incredible!

Maya:   All harmonics values are normal. Everything is under control.

Ritsuko: It is going to work!

Misato: Ready to launch.

 *Evangelion

Staff:  Release the first lock bolt!

Staff:  Released!

Staff:  Remove the umbilical bridge!

Staff:  Release the second lock bolt!

Staff:  Remove the first, then second bindings.

Staff:  Disengage the first through fifteenth safety locks.

Staff:  Internal battery fully charged.

Staff:  External power supply socket operational.

 *Nerv Headquarters

Maya:   Okay. Eva Unit-01 to the launching pad.

 *Evangelion is ready to be launched.

Maya:   Course clear. All green.

Ritsuko: It's ready for launch.

Misato: Okay. 
        Not that it matters, right?

Gendo:  Of course it does. We have no future unless we beat the Angels.

Fuyutsuki: Ikari, are you truly satisfied with this?

Misato: Launch!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Angel walking in the city

 *Eva appears on the ground

Misato: Shinji-kun... Come back alive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ending Theme Song

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Trailer: Eva defeats Angel, but this is only the beginning of everything. 
         Shinji runs away from his father and Misato's pride makes 
         her decide to become his guardian. Next is 'Unknown Ceilings'. 
         Of course, next time, service, service.
