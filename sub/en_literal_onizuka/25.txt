        Neon Genesis Evangelion
        Episode 25: The World Ending

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        The reason to exist, La raison d'etre

                        The reason to be allowed to be here.

                        Ikari Shinji. In his case,

                        The boy wished to die.

                        The other boy accepted this wish.

                        The Final Angel disappeared.

                        Yet, Ikari Shinji is anguished.

                        Why did you kill?

                        Why did you kill?

                        Why did you kill?

                        Why did you kill?

                        Why did you kill?

Shinji:         There was no other choice!

                        Why did you kill?

Shinji:         Because Kaoru-kun was an Angel!

                        Although he was human as well?

Shinji:         No! An Angel!
                He was our enemy!

                        Although he was human as well?

Shinji:         NO! NO! I SAID NO!

Rei:            He was a human the same as me.

Shinji:         NO!
                He was an Angel!

Rei:            So you killed?

Shinji:         THAT'S RIGHT!
                Otherwise, we would've been killed.
                Everybody would've been killed.

Rei:            So you killed?

Shinji:         I didn't want to kill him.
                But, there's no other choice!


                        So you killed.

Shinji:         Help!

                        So you killed.

Shinji:         Help!

                        So  you killed.

Shinji:         Help!

                        So you killed.

Shinji:         Somebody help me!

                        So you killed.

Shinji:         Please! Is anyone there?! Somebody help me!

--
Shinji:         Yes. It's Kaoru-kun who should have survived.
                He was much better than I am.
                He should have survived.

Misato:         No.
                A survivor must have the will to survive.
                He wished to die.
                He abandoned the will to live, And depended on false hope.
                You weren't wrong.
--
Shinji:         Is that really true?

                        Anxiety


Shinji:         Was that what I wanted?

                        Obsession

Shinji:         I don't know.
                What should I do?
                What Should I DO?!


                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         What?

                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         Me.

                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         To be disliked.

                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         By whom?

                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         Who?

                        What do you fear?

Shinji:         My father!
                He deserted me!
                I was disliked.
                What shall I do if I'm not liked?
                What shall I do?
--
Shinji:         Where am I?
                Where should I go?
                Nothing visible.
                Nothing intelligible.
                ...
                Misato-san?
                Misato-san!
                Hey, where are you?
                Hey, where should I go from here?
                Misato-san!
                Asuka!
                Ayanami!
                Touji!
                Kensuke!
                Ritsuko-san!
                Kaji-san!
                Father!
                Mother!
                Tell me,
                What I should do?!
--
Shinji:         Evangelion Unit One.

Shinji:         I have to pilot this, after all,
                killing the one who I loved,
                obeying the words from my father and the others.
                You say I have to fight in this?
                Mom! say something! answer me!

--
                        Why do you pilot Eva?

Shinji:         'Cause People ask me to pilot it.


                        So you pilot it?

Shinji:         Isn't that OK? It's for the sake of humanity! Isn't it OK?


                        You pilot Eva for the sake of others?

Shinji:         Yes!
                It's a good thing.
                It's a very good thing.
                Everyone praises me, then.

Asuka:          That's a lie.
Shinji:         What?

Asuka:          Are you an idiot?
                After all, it's for your own sake.

Shinji:         Eh?

Asuka:          And you make excuses for yourself, as usual.

Shinji:         Do I?

Asuka:          To think that you are doing your best for the sake of
                       others, is itself an easy way to live.

Shinji:         Is that so?

Asuka:          In other words, you're lonely, Shinji.

Shinji:         Is that so?

Asuka:          It's nothing but a dependent or symbiotic relationship.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you want is for people to depend on you.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you do is to wait for someone to bring you happiness.
                False happiness.

Rei:            That's exactly what YOU do.

Asuka:          ah.
--
                        Soryuu Asuka Langley.
                        In her case,

Asuka:          I'm in Eva without wanting to be.
                I'm forced to be here.
                This junk won't move!
                Oh, no, it's me who's junk.

                I'm useless.
                No one needs me.
                No one needs a pilot who cannot pilot Eva.

Rei:            You are trying to find yourself within others.

Asuka:          Shut up!

                        Separation Anxiety.
--
Rei:            You fear being alone.

                        Separation Anxiety.

Rei:            You're afraid because you'd be erased along with others.

                        Separation Anxiety.

Asuka:          So you pilot.

                        Separation Anxiety.

Asuka:          Shut up!

                        Action of attachment.

Asuka:          Shut up! Shut up!
                I don't wanna be told that by a doll like you!
--
                        The third character

                        Ayanami Rei, in her case,

Rei:            Who am I?

Rei:            Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Who are you?

                        Ayanami Rei

Rei:            You are also Ayanami Rei?

Rei:            Yes. The thing called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            All these are the things called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why are all of these me?

Rei:            Because others call us Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why do you have a false mind and a false body?

Rei:            Not false, for I am I.

Rei:            No. you are a human whose false soul was made by a
                man named Ikari Gendou.
                You are a false object which is pretending to be a human.
                Look, you have a dark, invisible, and unintelligible  mind
                within you, where the true you exists.

Rei:            I am I.
                I've become me through the instrumentality of the links
                between me and others.

Rei:            I've been formed by interaction with others.

Rei:            The interaction with people and the flow of time change
                the shape of my mind.

                        Those are bonds?

Rei:            Yes. Those have formed me so far, the thing called Ayanami Rei.
                And, those will form me from now on.

                        Those are bonds?

Rei:            But, there's someone else who is the true you.

Rei:            You don't know her.

Rei:            Because you don't want to see that, you are trying to run away.

                        Because of fear.

Rei:            Because she might not have a human shape.
                Because the present me might disappear.

                        Fear

Rei:            One is afraid that the self will disappear.

Rei:            Fear?
                That doesn't make sense.

Rei:            The Self's world will disappear.

                        Aren't you afraid?

Rei:            The Self will disappear.

                       Aren't you afraid?

Rei:            No, I'm glad.
                I am the thing that wishes to die.
                All I need is despair.
                I want to be nothingness.

Rei:            No, you can't.
                You can't be nothingness.
                That person won't let you be nothingness.

Rei:            Still not allowed to return.

Rei:            I've existed because he's needed me.

Rei:            But, in the end.
                I'll be useless.
                I'll be deserted by him.

Rei:            I've hoped for this day, although I'm now afraid.

Gendou:         Let's go.
                You've existed for the sake of today, this day, Rei.

Rei:            Yes.

                        And,

                        The complementation
                        by the Instrumentality of Man
                        begins.

 Do you love me?
--B PART---
                        Shinji Again.

Shinji:         What feeling is this?
                That I feel like I have experienced before.
                My body seems like it's disappearing.
                Agreeable.
                I feel like I'm spreading, and becoming large,
                to here, there and everywhere.

                        That was the very beginning
                        of the complementation of the people
                        by the instrumentality of man.

                        the thing people lost.

                        the lost minds.

                        complimenting the vacuum in the mind.

                        The complementation
                        by the instrumentality of minds and soul begins.

                        All things return to nothingness.

                        The complementation
                        by the instrumentality of man
                        has just begun.

Gendou:         No,
                It's not that everything returns to nothingness.
                It's nothing but returning everything to the beginning.
                Nothing but returning things to the mother which
                has long since been lost.
                All the minds become one mind, obtaining peace forever.
                Nothing but that.
--
Misato:         Is that the Instrumentality of Man Project?

Ritsuko:        Right.
                We always have a vacuum, something lost in our minds.


                        That creates the starvation within minds.

                        That creates anxiety and fear within minds.

Ritsuko:        Everyone fears the darkness within their minds,
                which they try to escape, try to erase.
                That's how people live.
                But, nobody can ever escape from it.

Misato:         So you unify people's minds and
                make them compliment each other?
                On your own accord?
                You are poking your nose into other's business.
                That's nothing but cheap friendship.

Ritsuko:        Yet, you are the one who has wanted that.

Misato:         Really?

--
                        CASE 1

Misato:         Where am I?


                        (PART 1)

                        In the case of Katsuragi Misato


Shinji:         This is the me within your mind.

Misato:         At the same time, it's my mind within you, isn't it?

Shinji:         In order for me to find me, I have to feel many kinds of people.
                I have to gaze inside of me.
                I have to gaze into the Misato-san within me.
                What do you want?

                        You wanna be a good child.


Misato:         Must I be a good child?


                        Why?


Misato:         Since I don't have a daddy
                Since I have to help mom, I have to be a good child?
                But, I don't wanna be like you, mom.
                When daddy's away, mom is always crying.
                Don't cry!
                Don't depend!
                So, must I be a good child?
                So, don't I want to be disliked by daddy.

Misato:         But I hate my father.
                So, I hate good children.
                I hate them!
                I'm tired of
                keeping myself pure,
                keeping myself pretending to be pure.
                I'm tired.
                I want myself to get dirty.
                I wished to see myself dirty.

Ritsuko:        So, did you let him hold you?
                So, did you let that guy hold you?

Misato:         NO!
                Because I loved him, I let him do it.

Misato:         You truly loved him?

Misato:         Of course!
                He accepted what I truly was.

                        Really?


Misato:         He was gentle.


Misato:         NO!
                Don't show this to Shinji-kun!

Ryouji:         You don't have anything to be ashamed of now.

Misato:         I am ashamed of it.

Misato:         Why are you ashamed?
                You can show this to the guy you love,
                Moreover, you want to show it.

Misato:         NO! Stop!

Misato:         You should be happy to show this to Shinji.

Misato:         NO!
                NO! NO WAY!

Misato:         I wonder if,
                It's your father who you wanna show this to.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find peace in Kaji-kun's face.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find a peace in Kaji-kun's kindness.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find your father in Kaji-kun's arms.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         YES.
                I found my father within Kaji-kun back then.
                So fled from him.
                I was afraid.
                He was just like my father.
                But, it was because I was happy,
                It was joy.
                It was truly a wonderful joy!
                So I hated.
                So I left.

Ryouji:         No reason to begin a love, but a reason to end a love.

Misato:         You are kind enough,
                You are kind enough to, I hope, make me dirty.

Ryouji:         Don't hurt yourself only because you hate yourself now.
                That's only to cheat yourself by temporarily punishing yourself.
                Don't do that.

Misato:         And you're saying, "you must take care of yourself?"


Misato:         Guys always do that.
                And Guys work, and Guys go to their own world,
                leaving me behind.

Misato:         Just like my father.

Misato:         Always trying to escape from the hardships of reality.
                Hardships of reality?
                It's me?
                It's me.
                Yes. It's me.
                It's inevitable.

Shinji:         Stop it, Misato-san.


Misato:         I'm desperate about myself.
                I hate myself!

Misato:         Impure.
                Dirty!


Ritsuko:        Sloppy.


Misato:         Mean! Dirty!
                Is that the intercourse of adults? I hate it!


Makoto:         Congratulations for you promotion. Major Katsuragi.


Misato:         The me appreciated is the me who is
                playing to be appreciated.
                It's not the true me.


Misato:         The true me is always crying.


Misato:         Yes. I am happy!


                        Am I happy?


Misato:         I am happy.


                        Am I happy?


Misato:         I am happy....?


                        Am I happy?

Misato:         NO!
                This isn't happiness!


                        What's happiness?


Misato:         This is not the true me!
                I am only trying to think that.

Shinji:         Otherwise, we cannot live?

Shinji:         We are unstable unless we are together.

Rei:            Unstable.

Ritsuko:        Unless someone is in the same bed.

Asuka:          Are you afraid to sleep alone?

Maya:          Are you lonely when you sleep alone?

Ryouji:         You cannot stand the loss of minds.

Makoto:         Then, Anyone will do.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         YES, you wish to find some simple joy.
                You're trying to heal your mind with temporary escapes.
                You're using MEN.

Misato:         NO NO NO WAY!


                        At last, what does she want?

--
                        CASE 2

Asuka:          Where am I?

Shinji:         It's my mind within Asuka.

Asuka:          Then, it's my mind within Shinji.


                        In the case of Soryuu Asuka Langley.
                        Part 1


Shinji:         What do you want?


Asuka:          I can live alone.
                I don't need daddy or mommy.
                I'll live alone.
                I won't cry anymore.

Asuka:          (crying)

Asuka:          Yet, I'm crying.
                Why am I crying?


Step mother:    It's difficult for me to deal with that child.

Asuka's father: You're worried? It's not like you, a doctor.

Step mother:    A Doctor is a human,
                as I said before.

Father:         Well, still it's not like you against a kid.

Step mother:    She is quite adult in some ways,  with a total rejection,
                with a tension, that I'm often afraid of.
                Don't you think so?

Father:         Well,
               you are Asuka's mother, after all.

Step mother:    I became your wife before that.

Father:         Didn't you become them at the same time?

Step mother:    Yes, from a social standpoint.
                However, I can stop being her mother at anytime, though
                you cannot stop being her father.

Father:         That might be true.


Asuka:          NO! STOP!
                Don't stop being my mother!
                I'm going to be a good child, whom you'd love.
                So, don't stop being my mother.
                So, look at me!
                Stop MOM, don't kill me!

Kyouko:         Your daddy now hates mommy.
                Your daddy deserted me.
                Or, I knew, he's never loved me from the very beginning.
                He has never needed me, I guess.
                So, die together with mommy.
                Daddy does not need us.

Asuka:          Am I in the way?
                Am I useless?

Kyouko:         Please, let's die together.

Asuka:          NO!
                I'm not your doll.
                I can think by myself, I can live by myself.

Asuka:          At that time, Mom was hung from the ceiling.
                She looked very happy.


Asuka:          But I hated her face then.
                I don't wanna die.
                I don't wanna let myself disappear.
                I don't like boys.
                I don't like daddy and mommy.
                I don't like anybody!
                Nobody protects me.
                Nobody is with me.


                        What does she want?


Asuka:          So I'll live alone.
                But I don't want that.
                It's painful.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone!


Shinji:         Don't leave me.

Misato:         Don't desert me.

Asuka:          Don't kill me.

Shinji:         What's this?

Misato:         This is the Instrumentality of Man project that your
                 father has been working on.

Shinji:         This is?

Misato:         It's part of them, I think.

Asuka:          The truth is still unknown to us.

Ritsuko:        The things you perceive are the truth.

Rei:            Things within you.

Fuyutsuki:      And the things recorded in your memory will be your truth.

Ritsuko:        There is a truth that changes through the time.

Shinji:         This is the truth.
                The result of everything, is this?

Asuka:          Out of many truths, this is one.

Misato:         That's the result you wanted.

Shinji:         I wanted?

Rei:            Yes.
                Destruction, the world where nobody was saved.

Shinji:         NO. It's that nobody saved me.

Ritsuko:        Nobody can save you.

Ryouji:         This is what you wanted.

Asuka:          Destruction, Death, the return to nothingness,
                All of these did you wish for.

Misato:         This is reality.

Shinji:         What's reality?

Rei:            Your world.

Makoto:         With time, with space, with other people, a world of
                your own.

Shigeru:        The world where how to accept things and how to
                 perceive things is absolutely up to you.

Maya:           It's your world, only given to you now,


                        That is reality.


Misato:         Your world, which nobody else can deal with.

Shinji:         It's the world where everything is already created,
                   isn't it?

Ritsuko:        No, it's the world that you are creating.

Fuyutsuki:      The world that you are trying to create.


                        That is reality.


Misato:         The will to live.

Asuka:          The mind that wishes to die, which you yourself want.

Shinji:         This darkness, this incomplete world...
               Are you saying, I wished for all of these?

Asuka:          Yes.

Ryouji:         The closed world where nobody but you are confortable.
                That is the very world you wished for.

Makoto:         To protect your weak mind.

Shigeru:        To protect your joy.

Maya:           This is the result.

Misato:         In a closed space with nobody but you in it,
                Nobody can live.

Asuka:          But you wanted this world, a closed world for yourself.

Ritsuko:        Excluding what you hate, you wanted a world of solitude.
                A mind all your own.

Rei:            This is your world delivered, with a small haven in your
                 mind.

Asuka:          This is one of the conclusions.

Misato:         The end of the world that you have lived in.


                        And the way to the complementation,

                        will be continued.
