OPENING THEME SONG

------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Eva is ready for the battle against 'ANGEL'. Shinji is in Eva Unit One.
*Misato and Ritsuko are in the operating room of Nerv underground.

Misato: Are you ready, Shinji-kun?

Shinji: Ah, yes.

Misato: Release the final safety lock! Evangelion Unit One, lift off!

Misato: Shinji-kun, think only of walking now.

Shinji: Walk...

Ritsuko: It's walking!

Shinji: Walk...

*Eva falls forward.

Misato: Shinji-kun, come on! Hurry, stand as fast as you can!

*ANGEL lifts Eva up and grasps Eva's left arm tightly.

Misato: Shinji-kun, keep calm. It's not your arm!

Ritsuko: How is Eva's protection system?

Maya:   Signal's not working.

Makoto: Field has not developed!

Ritsuko: It's useless?!

*ANGEL breaks Eva's left arm.

Maya:   Left arm has been damaged.

Makoto: The circuits have snapped.

Misato: Shinji-kun, break free!

*ANGEL batters at Eva's head.

Maya:   Front area of the head cracked!

Ritsuko: The armor cannot take much more.

     #Japanese word above 'EMERGENCY' has the same meaning.

Shigeru: Head damaged, extent unknown!

Maya:   Control nerves snapping one after another.

Makoto: No response from pilot.

Misato: Shinji-kun!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji: An unknown ceiling...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TITLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPISODE: 2
UNKNOWN CEILING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     #In this series, there are a Japanese title and an English one for each
        episode. The English one has different meaning from the Japanese
        one. This episode has 'Mishiranu, Tenjo (Unknown Ceiling)' and
        'BEAST' as the titles.

*A tent in the center of the ANGEL's self-explosion

     #Japanese words above 'DANGER, KEEP OUT' has the same
        meaning, literally 'DANGER, KEEP OUT AREA'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Lorentz: The second coming of Angels... It's too abrupt.

Member(yellow): It's just like fifteen years ago. Disasters always
        strike without notice.

Member(red): This may be fortunate for us from the view that our prior 
        investment has come to nothing.

Member(blue): Things have yet to turn out. If it ends up being useless, 
        then it's a waste.

Member(yellow): That's right.  As for the anti-Angel measures now commonly 
        known, Nerv must control the information about them both quickly 
        and appropriately.

Gendo: That matter has been taken care of. Don't worry.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Misato is changing TV channels in the tent

*Channel 12
     #'Government's Urgent Press Announcement'(center) and 'On the
        spot broadcasting'(right) at the bottom of the display.

TV:     The Government announcement this morning regarding yesterday's 
        state of special emergency says...

*Channel 4
     #'Mayumi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary' at the bottom.

TV:     In this incident...

*Channel 8

TV:     The U.N. forces in Japan...

     #'BS' means a satellite broadcasting.

*Misato is fanning herself.

Misato: The announcement was "Scenario D-22". The facts were hushed
        up again.

Ritsuko: The people in the Public Relations Department seem happy to
        finally have something to do.

Misato: They seemed rather optimistic.

Ritsuko: Well... The truth is that everyone is afraid.

Misato: Of course...
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Lorentz(?): Well, that's what it is.

Member(green): But, Ikari-kun, Nerv and Eva... you could use them in
        better ways, couldn't you?

Member(yellow): The cost of repairs for Unit Zero, and for the damage Unit
         One received in its first battle, would be a country's ruin.

Member(red): I heard you gave that toy to your son.

Member(blue): Lives, time and money... How much will be spent by you and
        your son before you are satisfied?

Member(red): Besides, you have another job to do, don't you?

     #The cover of the report says:
     #TOP SECRET
     #HUMAN COMPLEMENT PROJECT
     #TOP-LEVEL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
     #17TH INTERIM REPORT
     #HUMAN COMPLEMENT COMMITTEE
     #PROJECT OUTLINES FOR FISCAL 2015
     #SUMMARY

Member(red): The Human Complement Project--that is what you must give
        the highest priority.

Member(yellow): That's right. That project is our only hope in such
        hopeless circumstances.

Lorentz: Anyway, even though Angels have come again, that project must not
        fall behind schedule.  As for the budgets, we'll consider them.

Member(?): Well, the committee will take over now.

Member(yellow): Ikari-kun, thank you.

Lorentz: Ikari, you can't go back now.

Gendo:  I understand. Humanity has no more time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji stands in a corridor, gazing out a window.
* Rei passes by him, wheeled by on a hospital bed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Misato and Ritsuko are in the truck, headed back.

Misato: I've always thought that the air conditioner is the greatest
        treasure of humanity! It's a true scientific success!

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun has recovered consciousness.

Misato: How is he?

Ritsuko: No external wounds, but his memory is somewhat confused.

Misato: Can't be... Is it mental contamination?

Ritsuko: I was told not to worry about it.

Misato: I see... It's like that. Because it happened so suddenly...

Ritsuko: It's no wonder. A severe burden was imposed on his cranial 
        nerves.

Misato: His M-I-N-D, you keep forgetting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Shinji is sitting in the hospital waiting room, looking at his left arm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


*A big gun is being moved

     #The sign (a constructor's duty) says:

Misato: If Eva and this city function properly, we'll be able to win.

Ritsuko: You will defeat the Angels? You are as optimistic as always.

     #Japanese on the big parts moved across the display means:
     #'DANGER, HIGH TENSION VOLTAGE, CAUTION

Misato: Wishful thinking is a necessity for human life.

Ritsuko: I guess. Your optimistic character is refreshing.

Misato: See you.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     #The sign says:
     #1st CRANIAL NERV
     #EMERGENCY EXIT

* A background announcement.

* Misato comes for Shinji.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji and Misato are waiting for the elevator to come. The door opens and
* they find Gendo within. Shinji turns his face away and the door closes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Shinji and Misato are on an escalator.

Ritsuko (voice): Is it all right that they live together?

Fuyutsuki (voice): For Ikari and his son, it's natural to be separated.

Ritsuko (voice): If anything, it's unusual for them to live together...
        isn't it...?
------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Shinji and Misato stand before a man at the model of Nerv.

     #DISTRICT F, GEO-FRONT, TOKYO-3          RESIDENT'S CARD
     #6-24, DISTRICT F, GEO-FRONT, TOKYO-3
     #1: Ikari Shinji                                  0001-137-2

Misato: Alone?

Man in charge: Yes, his room is located there in Block 6. That all right?

Shinji: Yes.

Misato: Are you happy with it, Shinji-kun?

Shinji: I prefer being alone. Every place is the same.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     #The color of a normal public telephone which accepts coins and a
     #telephone card is GREEN. The color of a brand-new one which has
     #terminals for information network.

Ritsuko: What did you say?!

Misato: Like I said, I've decided to look after of Shinji-kun. I've
        received our superior's permission. Don't worry--it's not like 
        I'll have an affair with the kid.

Ritsuko: That goes without saying! What the hell are you thinking?!

Misato: She never could take a joke.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Misato drives her blue car through a tunnel.

Misato: Well, we'll have a wild time tonight, right?

Shinji: What are you talking about?

Misato: There's a welcoming party for new roommates, of course!
------------------------------------------------------------------------


     #The sign says: 'CONVENIENCE'.
     #'K' on the sign. As you know, 'K-Mart' in the U.S. and 'Circle K' in
     #Japan. There are many convenience stores in Japan.

     #You can see only many instant foods which Misato is going to buy.
     #'Tasty corned beef', 'Hamburg of beef 100%', 'Pork soup Chinese
     #noodle(Tonkotsu Ramen', Packed lunch (Bento)' ......
     #It's an example of convenient but poor meals ......
     #A donation box for poor people is at a cashier.

Housewife A: Are you going to move, too?

Housewife B: I never seriously thought that this city would become a 
        battlefield.

Housewife A: My husband told me that for safety our children and
        I should move.

Housewife B: Move for safety... Even in this fortress city, we can't rely 
        on anything at all.

Housewife A: The mere thought of yesterday's incident makes me shudder.

Housewife B: Really...

------------------------------------------------------------------------


*The car is going along the road to the top of the hill.

Misato: Well, we'll stop by some place along the way.

Shinji: Where are we going?

Misato: (giggle) It... is... a... good... place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shinji: Somehow... this is a lonesome city, isn't it?

Misato: The time has come.

*Alarm

Shinji: Incredible! The buildings are growing!

Misato: This is the fortress city for Angel interception--"Tokyo-3". 
        Our hometown... and the town which you protected.

Misato: I think your stuff has arrived.

     #Boxes printed 'MITTU' at the entrance of Misato's room are the
     #ones used for movement. There are similar boxes from a carrier
     #named 'NITTSU(or NITTU)'.

Misato: Actually, I just moved into town the other day myself.

Misato: Come in.

Shinji: Errr... May I come in? (OJAMASHIMASU)

Misato: Shinji-kun, this is your home!

Shinji: I... I'm back. (TADAIMA)

Misato: Welcome home! (OKAERINASAI)

*The name plate on the door says 'Katsuragi'.

     #Japanese Greeting (Everyone says like the below)
     #Someone comes home and says  'TADAIMA'
     #In answer to 'TADAIMA', the person at home says 'OKAERI(NASAI)'
     #But when someone visit other's houses, the visitor says 'OJAMASHIMASU'
     #These greetings are very important in the context related to 'Home'.
     #If you've seen 'Gunbuster', you ought to have seen a touching
     #'OKAERINASAI'.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


*How untidy it is!

Misato: Well, the room's a little messy... but just ignore it.

* Beer cans, whisky bottles and potato chips (you see Japanese 'Potechi')
  are on the dinning table

     #Some moving boxes. The Japanese written on them says that
     #there are clothes for the winter in them. A car magazine on the
     #top has written 'Overseas New Model's Sudden Unveiling'

Shinji: Such a... a little...

Misato: Ah, sorry, just toss the food in the refrigerator, please.

Shinji: Ah, yes.

Shinji: Ice...

Shinji: Condiments...

     #Tongue, roast chicken, Relish cut cheese (with salami)

Shinji: Only beer... What kind of life does she lead?

     #'YEBICHU' is from 'YEBISU,' which I love to drink. She has good
     #taste in beer. The price is 10 yen higher than other beers because
     #it is made from 100% malt. Sometimes they confused 'YEBICHU'
     #with 'YEBISU'. 'YEBISU' is originally the name of one of the Seven
     #Deities of Good Fortune.

Shinji: Well, the refrigerator over there--

Misato: Ah, it's okay. Maybe later... I'm changing now.

Shinji: Changing...?
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Microwave Oven: Chin!

     #We say 'Doing chin(chin-suru)'.
     #Food like balls with a toothpick in a box is TAKOYAKI, tasty foods
     #especially in Osaka.


Misato: Itadakimasu!

Shinji: Itadakimasu.

     #Japanese Greeting (Everyone says like the below)
     #Before meals: ITADAKIMASU   (Literally: I'll eat.)
     #After meals: GOCHISOSAMA(DESHITA)   (literally: It was a good
     #meal.)

* Misato chugs a beer

Misato: Phaaaaaah Kwaaaaaah!! Oh, my dear life! I just live for these times! 

Misato: Ah, you're not eating? It might be instant food, but it's pretty 
        good.

Shinji: No, but... I'm just not used to this kind of meal.

Misato: No! Don't be fussy!

Shinji: Ah... No-- I... didn't mean that.

Shinji: Uh...

Misato: Don't you think it's nice? 
        
Misato: Having a meal with others?

Shinji: Ah... yes.

*Shinji and Misato do JANKEN (the game of 'paper, rock and scissors')

     #JANKEN is similar to TOSSING A COIN. JANKEN is a convenient
     #and popular way to decide the winner because many people can
     #do together and need only their own hands.
     #Rule: You can do three kinds of hand's forms, GU, CHOKI, PA.
     #GU is 'stone', CHOKI is 'Scissors' and PA is 'paper'. GU can defeat
     #CHOKI, CHOKI can defeat PA and PA can defeat GU. Guess the
     #reasons. The situation when no one wins is called AIKO.
     #In this case, Misato who showed GU finally win the game over
     #Shinji who showed CHOKI after four AIKO.


Misato: Well, next. Here goes!

Misato: Jan-ken-pon!

Misato: Pon!

Misato: Pon!

Misato: Pon!

Misato: Pon!

     #The table says:
     #OUR EVERYDAY DUTIES TABLE
     #First Line: (To-Do/a day of the week)(Sun)(Mon)(Tue)(Wed)(Thurs)
     #   (Fri)(Sat)

     #Misato is very good at JANKEN.

Misato: Ahh, you were unlucky, Shinji-kun. 
        Good, now that the everyday duties have been fairly decided, 
        everything's okay.

Shinji: Yes...

Misato: Well, since from now on this is your house, you can really feel 
        at home here.

Shinji: Ah, ah, yes...

Misato: Hey! Yes, yes, yes, yes... What a gloomy person! You're a BOY,
        aren't you? Pull yourself together!

Shinji: Ah... yes.

Misato: That's okay. Take a bath and wash away all the unpleasant things.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*PenPen appears.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Shinji bursts in naked, startled at PenPen.

Shinji: Wowowowowowowow! Mi-- Mi-- Mi-- Misato-san!

Misato: What?

Shinji: Wha-- Wha-- What-- What's tha--

Misato: Oh, him? He's a new kind, a hot spring penguin.

Shinji: What the...?

Misato: His name is PenPen. He's another roommate.

Misato: By the way... you might want to cover your front.

Misato: A little too flamboyant, maybe? I might be the one seen through...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Shinji is taking a bath.

Shinji: Katsuragi Misato-san...  She's not a bad person.

Misato (flashback): Taking a bath is a life washing.

Shinji: In a bath, more unpleasant things come to my mind than any 
        other time. 

Shinji: Father and... Ayanami Rei?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The room has been seriously destroyed. Was it caused by that accident?

Ritsuko: How was Rei? This afternoon, you did go... to the hospital?

Gendo:  She will be able to move in 20 days. I'll get the committee's 
        permission to restart the frozen Unit Zero then.

Ritsuko: So much pain... they bear...

Gendo:  There are no other people who can use Eva so, for as long as they
        live, I will let them do that.

Ritsuko: Whatever what the children think... right?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     #The sign on the door says:
     #'Shin-chan's Room'
     #'Shinji' is often called 'Shin-chan' with familiarity.

     #The paper says:
     #TOKYO-3 PUBLIC 1ST JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
     #TRANSFER NOTIFICATION
     #IKARI SHINJI

Misato: Yes. He's had such a bitter experience. I'm afraid that he won't get
        over it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Misato is taking a bath while talking on a telephone.

Ritsuko: Caring for him is your job, isn't it?

Misato: I'm afraid. I don't know how to get along with him.

Ritsuko:You're complaining now? You declared rather theatrically that you 
        would look after him, didn't you?

Misato: Shut up!

Misato: Then I was regarding him as my tool. I'm the same as Ritsuko.
        Even though we defeated the Angel... I don't feel happy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji is lying on his bed.

Shinji: This is an unknown ceiling, too. It's natural... all places in 
        this city are unknown to me.

Misato (flashback): This is your home.

Shinji: Why am I here?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Eva seems to have been defeated by ANGEL.
* Red, blood-like liquid spurts from the head.

     #Japanese in red says EMERGENCY

Shigeru: Head damaged, extent unknown!

Maya:   Trouble maintaining activity!

Misato: What's the status?

Maya:   Synchrograph has reversed. Pulses are flowing backward!

Ritsuko: Cut the circuits! Stop them!

Maya:   No use! The signal is refused. It can't be received!

Makoto: No response from the monitoring system. Life or death unknown!

Shigeru: Unit One is totally silent.

Ritsuko: Misato!

Misato: So much for this time... Stop the operation. Pilot's protection 
        has top priority. Eject the plug by force!

Maya:   Impossible. It's totally out of control.

Misato: What?!

*Eva's left eye flashes.

Female voice: Eva restarted!

Maya:   No! It can't move!

Misato: It can't be...

Ritsuko: Gone wild?

*Eva roars.

Fuyutsuki: We'll win.

Ritsuko: AT-Field...

Misato: We can't--as long as the Angel has its AT-Field--

Ritsuko: --Eva can't touch the Angel.

Shigeru: Left arm restored.

Misato: Incredible...

Maya:   Unit One expanding the AT-Field. It's neutralizing the phase 
        space.

Ritsuko: No, it's eroding...

Misato: That AT-Field easily...

*ANGEL hugs Eva's head, changing shape and covering it like a ball.

Misato: It's gonna self-destruct?!

* A big explosion.

Misato: Eva is...?

* Eva is walking, alive

Ritsuko: That is Eva's...

Misato: ...true appearance...

*Blackout

Shigeru: The circuits have been reconnected.

* A shot of Shinji conscious in the entry plug

Maya:   The system has recovered. The graph is in the normal position.

Makoto: Survival has been confirmed.

Ritsuko: Body Recovery Group, hurry up!

Misato: Pilot's protection is the top priority.

* Eva's helmet falls off, and one of Eva's eyes appears, seeming to stare 
* at Shinji.  Shinji starts screaming...

Shinji: Waaah...

------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Misato opens the door to Shinji's room and says...

Misato: Shinji-kun, may I open the door? 
        You've done something admirable. You can hold your head high. 
        Good night, Shinji-kun. 
        Cheer up.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preview:

Shinji, who has started a new life obediently conforming to his situation, 
cannot make new friends, even though being a pilot of Eva makes him 
popular. The next is "Unringing Telephone'. Next time, of course, I'll 
give you good service!
